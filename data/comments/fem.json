I think the \"common\" and \"uncommon\" referred to the sheets they were printed on, and they number how often the appeared, or something like that. So common1 was less common than common2.If I remember it correctly, people later roughly considered uc1 and uc2 to be rare, uc3 and c1 to be uncommon, and c2 and c3 as common. But in some sets were also more rarities. So saying \"this card was rare\" is probably a bit dumbed down, since it could have been a rare rare or a common rare. :)",

This guy is more like a one time \"free\" boost of mana. It and Blood Pet are good for setting up something in the mid game. Soldevi Adnate is more for the later game and casting big spells like, Consume Spirit.

To get more benefit than a simple [autocard]Swamp[/autocard], you'd need to invest 4(!) turns.  Compare this to the oft-reprinted [autocard]Ebon Stronghold[/autocard], and that cycle of lands, from the same set, which provide a little optional burst after they come into play tapped.\nThis card is overshadowed by one of the most powerful and game-defining spells of all time: [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard].  It's simply faster, simpler, and less prone to destruction than this land.  It's just way too slow for most black decks, even for its day.  It's also sub-optimal because you need to choose to untap it during your untap phase to use it, thus no longer gaining counters.  Good luck surprising anybody with your [autocard]Terror[/autocard] when you do that.\nHere's the storage land cycle for the curious:\n[B]: [autocard]Bottomless Vault[/autocard]\n[U]: [autocard]Sand Silos[/autocard]\n[G]: [autocard]Hollow Trees[/autocard]\n[R]: [autocard]Dwarven Hold[/autocard]\n[W]: [autocard]Icatian Store[/autocard]",

Ramp up your mana with some Myr and other trinkets, Smite down all their blockers and then sac artifacts like crazy and go in for a huge hit with one of your Atogs while leaving one of these on the field. \nIf the Atog hits, you win due to the combined damage from the attacker and the damage from your disciples, if they smite the Atog you can activate this sucker and gain a ton of life and use it to give you enough time to get another setup ready.\nNot a terrible card, just a bit more situational than it ought to be.",

Say you have a Juzam Djinn on the board alongside a drudge skeleton. You attack with both, your opponant obviously wont block the drudge since it can regerate and instead declares his trio of 2/2 drakes to block the Djinn and finish it off. Because the Drudge is unblocked you can tap the cube and pay two and then two more to save Juzam.Is it risky and messy? Yes, but that also makes it fun to pull off.",

      "content": "Those giving one- and two-star ratings aren't aware of the card in historical context.  They're used to a world where Deadbridge Goliath (2GG 5/5) is Standard-useless even before Polukranos existed.  As I have cast more Derelors in Standard (\"Type II\") tournaments than anyone on the planet, I shall defend it.\nin the first days of Standard (1995-96), the consensus best creature was Chronicles' reprinted Erhnam Djinn, a 4/5 for 3G that gives an opposing creature forestwalk each turn.  Even then, Derelor was lightly regarded by the masses.  The flavor text, essentially broadcasting \"this is a bad card\", didn't help.  But it was a 4-power 4-drop with a back end out of Bolt and Incinerate range whose biggest downside was that it loses a fight with Erhnam itself.\nDerelor was best in precisely the same scenarios as Erhnam: as a splash, possibly as the only black cards in your deck.  An Erhnam cast off a Karplusan Forest or Barbed Sextant has no downside (and possibly even upside, as you can give forestwalk to a small creature and then block - 'oops, no forests'); a Derelor has no downside if you've got no other black cards to cast.  You wouldn't put it in monoblack Necropotence, opting for Sengir Vampire or Ihsan's Shade instead.  You put it in, say, GW Erhnam-Geddon and cast it off Birds and Cities of Brass (while possibly fulfilling most of your Fallen Empires quota; the first PTQs mandated 5+ cards from all legal card sets).\nWhat's more, in tournaments, creatures have a short life.  They get countered, removed (Swords was legal when Derelor was), or die in combat.  If your Derelor (or Erhnam) dies, drawback gone; you didn't have to sacrifice something, pay life, etc. to cast it.  Your next Derelor costs 3B, not 3BB, and your other black spells revert to their retail price.  \nMy successful 1996 Standard deck was a mostly red midrange deck with 4 Derelor and 4 Erhnam Djinn (plus a Balance) splashed off pain lands, a few Cities, and 4 Barbed Sextant.  Derelor and Erhnam had no downside other than the 1 damage you often take summoning them.  My 1997 Standard was also mostly-red midrange with a threat base of 4 Derelor, 4 Wildfire Emissary, and 4 Hammer of Bogardan.  Stupors were the only other black cards.  They cost 3 and got played the turn before Derelor if I drew both.  Ergo, no drawback.\nIn September 1997, Tempest was released, showing the world once and for all that 2/1s for 1 and unblockable 2/Xs for 2 are infinitely more powerful than Erhnams and Juzams (pure-size, no-ability 4-drops), and Derelor and friends were consigned to the dustbin of history.  Erhnam and Sengir were reprinted in Odyssey block in 2002 and never got a whiff of Standard play.  But in its day, Derelor, 'the black Erhnam', was a great card which saw a fair amount of play and deserved more.",

With that said, I'd usually rather just drop an Regeneration on the creature in question, especially since lure decks generally used Verduran Enchantress and the like.Also note that it can be used during the end-of-combat step, after damage is dealt, functionally giving a creature Vigilance.",

So unless they have an untap, she stays locked down. Not to mention if you are playing with the cornerstone creatures, like the Goblin Chieftain he becomes a 1/3. I love this guy!",

There were a few reasons it got a bad rap at the time.\nFirst, it was overprinted, which caused prices to plummet and demand to eventually evaporate.  Even years after it went out of print, you could get fallen empires packs for 99 cents.\nOn top of this, it didn't actually have rares -- the cards listed as Fallen Empires rares today were actually just uncommons with fewer copies on the sheet, and you weren't guaranteed to get one in a pack, so many many packs of Fallen Empires were just common and uncommon junk.  (Of course, most of its 'semi-rares' were also fairly bad, which was another problem -- the good cards were common and uncommon, like this and Hymn to Tourach.  But either way, a pack of Fallen Empires was very likely to contain nothing new or worthwhile.)\nFinally, while it had a few bad cards in every color, every single blue card in Fallen Empires sucked (High Tide wouldn't really be useful until more blue land-untap effects were printed in the Urza block.)  This was probably deliberate, since blue was considered the most powerful color at the time and they likely wanted to tone it down; but it meant that entire decktypes got nothing out of the set.\nBut between this, [autocard]Goblin Warrens[/autocard], and [autocard]Goblin Chirurgeon[/autocard] it was one of the first to provide really interesting support for a creature type -- it made goblin decks actually fun and interesting rather than just \"get out your king, rush.\"",

Still, Fireblast and Reverberate for 8 still pales in comparison, and sets your curve back (Tap for , sac the Mountains for Fireblast, then Reverberate with floating mana). I'm sticking to my theory that this could be the best Burn combo available. Best in Standard, without a doubt.",

I use one of these in my personal favorite casual multiplayer [b]black[/b]/[b]red[/b] goblin deck. Because I am also running one [autocard]Demonic Tutor[/autocard] and one [autocard]Vampiric Tutor[/autocard], I occasionally have the ability to search out this card if necessary. I use cards such as: 4 [autocard]Knucklebone Witch[/autocard], 2 [autocard]Boggart Shenanigans[/autocard], 1 [autocard]Goblin Sharpshooter[/autocard], and 1 [autocard]Wort, Boggart Auntie[/autocard] to capitalize on sending goblins to the graveyard. I also included 4 [autocard]Mogg War Marshal[/autocard] to provide the fodder needed to use the heavy activation cost. This card is [b]very[/b] helpful when being attacked by creatures without trample. You are able to block the creatures, then sacrifice the blockers to produce more goblins. A [i]major drawback[/i] and another reason this card should be only a \"one of\" in a goblin deck is that it requires 2 goblins for the activation cost. It is not the card you want to see after a board wipe and an empty hand. If you want a more \"stable\" version, try [autocard]Weirding Shaman[/autocard]. Even alone, it can beat face or sacrifice itself to it's own ability. (Posted By: [b][u]Misago[/u][/b])",

No one will tell you Emrakul, Progenitus, or heck Dream Halls are bad cards unless they're idiots, but they're also cards that require a specific \"build around me\" status to work very well. Just because this can't be thrown into EVERY blue deck for *maximum* effect doesn't mean that it can't be thrown in for pretty-darn-good effect.\nFurther, unlike Dark Ritual, High Tides stack in a beautiful way. You tap for 1, then play high tide. Tap for 2, play two more. Now the third island produces more mana than the original 3 islands you had! I have a mill deck that goes off TURN 3 because of High Tide shenanigans. All it takes is a single untapper and a draw engine and you'll run into other untappers of various kinds. Further, it's trivial to create infinite combos with this card:\n(([autocard]Earthcraft[/autocard] + any 1 creature) OR [autocard]Argothian Elder[/autocard] OR [autocard]Juniper Order Druid[/autocard]  OR [autocard]Krosan Restorer[/autocard] OR [autocard]Ley Druid[/autocard]  OR [autocard]Magus of the candelabra[/autocard])+ [autocard]freed from the reel[/autocard] OR [autocard]pemmin's aura[/autocard] = infinite mana.\nEven better, things like Twiddle become Rite of Flames, Dark Rituals, or even better. Dark Ritual literally has no cards that cause infinite combos so easily and is nearly ALWAYS a card disadvantage. High Tides into a draw engine such as Brain Geyser can easily net 2+ cards (plus the others you had to use) resulting in card advantage, and that's without abusing it. WITH abusing it you fill up your hand, dump it, fill it, dump it, etc and you'll quickly get to your wincons as you do. Even better, once you do, you likely have yet even more untappers, protection, and the mana to cast those wincons right off. \nFurther, enemies only have a slim opening to reliably counter the set of cards you'll play and if they screw it up you have the mana to counter their counter and go right back on doing what you were. Rewind works wonderfully for completing this once you're floating enough mana.",

Sure, most people hate 6 CMC and higher cards, but I feel thats wrong. With this, you can easily bring out big cards sooner. With doubling season, this becomes crazy.X spells will LOVE this card, especially green. while green already has good accel, this is great 'suicide' mana, for a hail mary play, like a big fireball.",

The place would be overrun with all manner of strange and powerful thrulls, homarids, and thallids.  It would also hold many buried treasures from the empires that had fallen.  And there might be a couple outposts of grizzled orcs and dwarves that had *GASP* joined forces and adapted into one society that had learned to live in cohabitation with all these strange new creatures.  Now that would be a new take on dwarves and orcs wouldn't it?  If they had adapted to become the best of friends over the years in order to survive the same circumstance.  (Wizards: Feel free to take this idea and run with it.)\nI would like to see a card named:  Droning Queen  Summon Homarid  Casting cost: U  She is a 0/1 that gives all other homarids +2/+2.  So the other homarids in this set would have meh casting costs too, but with a queen on the board they are much stronger.  With two queens on the board they are really strong and the queens are actually 2/3's then.

      "content": "Card of the Week #4 (1 day late)\nPrevious Card - Skyshroud Condor\nOh yes. Homarid indeed. Oh how I love the random card button.\nSo, what exactly can you do with a 2/2 for 3, that sucks 1/4 the time and is meh 1/2 the time and is decent 1/4 the time? You could suggest they make this card a 3/3 to be playable, OR you could play it anyway, because it is in fact a homarid.\nI'm going to go with the latter suggestion. So I'm going to play with Homarid. Yes that card from Fallen Empires. Yes that is in fact one of my favorite blocks. So what if it's bad. So flavorful! So much art! God I love that about fallen empires. I recently went out of my way to buy a play set of thallid from fallen empires, one of each art. They are that cool. I want to do that with Homarid, because this card is so cool. In case you are wondering, my favorite Thallid art is the Ron Spencer art and my favorite Homarid art is the Quinton Hoover art. \nAlas, I appear to have digressed for a few sentences, so back to playing a Homarid in a deck. And by that I mean an EDH deck. Where would you play Homarid in an EDH deck. You wouldn't look for the general whose strategy it would fit under, you would create an EDH deck just for Homarid, and just for the beautiful flavor in that beautiful four fold art package.\nSo let's make a deck list for Homarid EDH, it will have to be mono blue and have to have all the Homarid and Tide counter cards. Lets start the list\nHomarid\nHomarid Shaman\nHomarid Spawning Bed\nHomarid Warrior\nTidal Influence\nHow beautifully short! But what does that say on Homarid Spawning Bed? Camarids? Lets get every other card that references those things to held add bulk and flavor.\nSarpadian Empires, Vol. VII\nYep, thats it. Alright, so for this Homarid deck we have 6/100 cards. This is fun. No, lets find a general. A mono blue General. What are some good options, and why?\nChisei, Heart of Oceans - Counter manipulation that compliments the Homarid ability and an Ocean flavor\nKeiga - It is the \"tide\" star\nLorthos - The \"Tide\"maker\nIt probably doesn't matter, but I'm going to roll with Chisei, because I like counter manipulation. So, we have 6 cards and a general and I'll leave 35 cards aside for land base. That makes 42/100 cards. \nSo Homarids, they come from the ocean, they use lots of counters, tidal flavor, cyclical flavor. I can roll with this. Lets get some more tidal flavor.\nDream Tide\nHigh Tide\nInexorable Tide (Also provides cool counter manipulation)\nKeiga, the Tide Star\nLorthos, the Tidemaker\nParallax Tide\nRushing Tide Zubera\nSliptide Serpent\nStormtide Leviathan\nTideforce Elemental\nTideshaper Mystic\nTidespout Tyrant\nTidewalker\nTidewater Minion\nTidal Bore\nTidal Courier\nTidal Flats\nTidal Kraken\nTidal Surge\nTidal Visionary\nTidal Warrior\nTidal Wave\nThat makes for 65/100. Now we have three glaring needs. First off, there's quite a bit of krakens, leviathans, etc, so lets throw in a Quest for Ula's Temple, for giggles, which makes 66/100. Second, we need more counter bearing cards and counter messing cards. Third, this is ocean themed, we need more Island matters cards, like island walk and such.\nLets start with a list of possible counter bearing cards\nAquitect's Will\nChronozoa\nCoral Reef\nFloodchaser\nGiant Oyster\nHalimar Wavewatch\nIceberg\nIllusionary Terrain\nRiver Kelpie\nSteady Progress\nAll descent counter bearing/manipulating blue cards that fit into the Homarid theme and flavor. This will make 76/100. Now a list of more island matter cards.\nBenthic Behemoth\nDeep-Sea Serpent\nDreamwinder\nFishliver Oil\nFlooded Shoreline\nFloodgate\nHarbor Serpent\nIsland Fish Jasconius\nHammerhead Shark\nGiant Shark\nDevouring Deep\nDandan\nJokulmorder\nKukemssa Serpent\nLeviathan\nLingering Mirage\nManta Ray\nMarjhan\nPiracy Charm\nSea Monster\nSea Serpent\nSea's Claim\nSeasinger\nSegovian Leviathan\nSerpent of the Endless Sea\nSlipstream Eel\nSlipstream Serpent\nSpreading Seas\nThing from the Deep\nVodalian Serpent\nThat Brings our count up to 105/100, which means we'll need to cut five cards. Lets cut the fish, as they don't complement Quest for Ula's Temple. Say goodbye to\nIsland Fish Jasconius\nHammerhead Shark\nGiant Shark\nDevouring Deep\nDandan\nAlright That brings our count down to 100/100 cards. Now lets find a mana base. I want at least 20 Islands. Actually I'd make them Snow-Covered Islands just to confuse our opponent. So what lands should be run besides basics? Let's take a look.\nCoral Atoll\nHalimar Depths\nReliquary Tower\nSand Silos\nSaprazzan Skerry\nSvyelunite Temple\nAnd the Rest are Snow-Covered Islands. \nNow you can always tweak to your liking. More counters, less Leviathans. More Proliferate when it comes out. find some good artifacts to throw in. Whatever you want. But if you really want to run Homarid EDH what you really have to do is have a really cool play group and convince them to let you run Homarid (this card) as your general. If you can do it, I say you run Homarid EDH, and be hailed in all places.",

It would have been so much simpler to make it something like \"Banding - tap: target creature gets +X/+Y, where X is this creatures power and Y is this creatures toughness.\" (They tried to do this to a small extent, see the comments on [autocard]infantry veteran[/autocard], but it wasn't done very well). They could have kept a lot of the same functionality with abilities like \"sacrifice this creature: regenerate target creature this creature banded with this turn\". Things like camel would still work: \"prevent all damage dealt by deserts to creatures this creature banded with this turn\".\nSure, this misses out on the evasion loss, damage allocation, and things like first strike, lifelink, etc, but those just added to the confusion. Everyone understood a band could deal the sum of everythings power in damage. They didnt get that you could put more than lethal damage on your 1/1 banding to save the rest of your band and hose trampling or that they could block an entire band as long as they could block 1 thing or that you needed all but 1 bander on offense, but only 1 bander on defense.\nBanding had so many of its own rules that it needed to either be an extremely common ability or be simpler. As a somewhat rare ability in one color, it was just too confusing to keep. Sure, you understood it, but your opponent didn't.",

In a soldier deck, it then forms an extra body to block or attack with.\nKirschner's Art is by far my favorite.  I remember reading an article in the Duelist about the artist, and his philosophy on art was to create an image that was absent of any preexisting frame of reference.  Benson's version is less imaginative (and she my favorite artist) and Beard went in a Greco-Roman direction.  Also, the shadow halo effect is less obvious on the Fallen Empires original.",

[autocard]Land Tax[/autocard] could allow you to fetch tons of lands, while you continued pumping out creatures, holding the white mana for a big [autocard]Akron Legionnaire[/autocard] or [autocard]Elder Land Wurm[/autocard] or whatever bloated white fatty people used to use in the lategame (I know, I was joking about when [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] was considered too powerful to be printed).\nHere's the storage land cycle for the curious:\n[B]: [autocard]Bottomless Vault[/autocard]\n[U]: [autocard]Sand Silos[/autocard]\n[G]: [autocard]Hollow Trees[/autocard]\n[R]: [autocard]Dwarven Hold[/autocard]\n[W]: [autocard]Icatian Store[/autocard]",

Even then though, your opponent has to find a way to deal with him, either by blocking or by wasting a removal spell on him (which against a {B} creature can be hard to come by). My only criticism is the fact that using the ability negates the combat damage, this is a mechanic often seen on older cards but it still isn't as threatening to have this guy come through unblocked and deal 2 damage or that player discards three cards, instead of dealing 2 damage and that player discards three cards.Works well with mechanics that make him unblockable, such as Goblin Tunneler, or Whispersilk Cloak as other players have mentioned.",

Just a beach with some sand piles, that in mysterious ways generate mana, and tell a tiny part of a story about a plane. :)The card by itself can be ok for Commander or other slow multiplayer formats, I guess.

At a time when land destruction was so rampant and cheap, this could easily set you back very very far.  To give you some idea of how slow these lands are, note that they all enter the battlefield tapped, and then require you to tap to remove counters.  To get more benefit than a simple [autocard]Island[/autocard], you'd need to invest 4(!) turns.  Compare this to the difficult-to-pronounce [autocard]Svyelunite Temple[/autocard], and that cycle of lands, from the same set, which provide a little optional burst after they come into play tapped.\nHowever, this one is arguably more playable than its contemporaries, because of the nature of blue decks in those days to grind the game out many turns.  However, its design prevents it from being used unless you leave it untapped, which prevents it from getting more counters.  This is obviously not a great fit in a deck running countermagic, though it might have more use powering out [autocard]Deep Spawn[/autocard] and the like.\nHere's the storage land cycle for the curious:\n[B]: [autocard]Bottomless Vault[/autocard]\n[U]: [autocard]Sand Silos[/autocard]\n[G]: [autocard]Hollow Trees[/autocard]\n[R]: [autocard]Dwarven Hold[/autocard]\n[W]: [autocard]Icatian Store[/autocard]",

That way you have still all your forests untapped to attack with. With 6 forests, them being 2/3, that's already 12 damage attacking. And not that many will die either, with their three toughness. And if you got some pump spell... Not awesome, but over the near 20 years of powercreep, he's still somewhat playable.Might also be good in a deck, where you want to sacrifice creatures constantly.

If you have maybe ten 1/1 camarid tokens from homarid spawning bed, and give them all first strike, they can easily take apart any attacker without dying. And preventing your dudes from gaining first strike would cost your opponent up to 10 mana. And even if your opponent does pay it, you can just activate the flats again to give your units first strike anyway.So, I don't think it's that bad... still bad, but not unplayably bad.",

In the original version, it was just the last sentence.I guess they added it because they thought it is a bit strong with homarid spawning bed. Like, you have 10 camarid tokens in play and 4 tidal influence. In two of four turns, they'd be 1/1. In one of four turns, they'd be 0/1, and in one of four turns, they'd be 11/1.",

Naturally, when used with actual Homarids, it is annoyingly confusing and a great way to waste a lot of time and effort on nothing. And, like Homarids, it starts weak just to prevent it from being useful. No idea why this wasn't Legendary or an Enchant World... it is as if they forgot those types of cards existed as a way to prevent duplicates.",

I'm sure this can be exploited, but it paints a target on a land, when lands don't even need targets painted on them.

As with many such creatures, the threat of having to spend one extra can change the way someone plays the game - or forces the use of removal on this annoyance.  While it's not amazing, and can be easily killed, it's not completely unplayable, especially considering the time it was printed.As for power creep in modern Magic, just imagine a creature with Mana Leak sewn on.  That would be insane.As for the art...the art direction of early sets was often hilarious.  You had, in the same set, this guy, and Melissa Benson's Vodalian Soldiers, who looked like the Lord of Atlantis of old.  What can I say?",
