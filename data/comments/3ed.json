Yes, that template is hilarious by modern standards. No, this card is not worth four mana. No, Douglas Shuler cannot claim the same level of technical mastery that today’s crop of artists can. But this card--along with many of its brethren--is etched into my brain. It is one of the seeds that the tree that is my love of [b]Magic [/b]grew out of.\nGranted, most of its familiarity comes from opening it in countless boosters, sorting it into endless piles in the neverending quest to organize my collection, or flipping past it in boxes and binders looking for more awesome blue [i]Revised [/i]uncommons like [autocard]Control Magic[/autocard], [autocard]Counterspell[/autocard], or [autocard]Clone[/autocard]. I vaguely remember putting it into a deck of some sort years ago, probably trying to animate [autocard]Aladdin's Lamp[/autocard] the same way everyone else tried to back then.\nI do find it fascinating that, while we have put this effect onto global enchantments ([autocard]Titania's Song[/autocard], [autocard]March of the Machines[/autocard]), instants ([autocard]Karn's Touch[/autocard]), and reusable activated abilities ([autocard]Karn, Silver Golem[/autocard]; [autocard]Xenic Poltergeist[/autocard]; [autocard]Toymaker[/autocard]), we haven’t done an Aura with this ability since the original.

It has a very reasonable casting cost, and can be quite a complementary card to Dingus Egg in decks based around land destruction (LD).  The Ankh isn't particularly choosy when it comes to who it damages, however, so you need to protect yourself.  Cards like Circle of Protection: Artifact can absorb the damage at a cost, but it's better to play Ankh of Mishra when you know you don't need to play any more lands.  Ankh of Mishra is part of a vicious combo with Parallax Tide that can deal a lot of damage to your opponent really fast.",

It is banned in Legacy and restricted in Vintage (granted, it isn’t a big player in Vintage, mostly because it is hard to predict how most decks are going to play out with regard to lands, creatures, and cards in hand). But just try playing it in a game using otherwise “normal” cards--it is a complete and utter backbreaker for only two mana.\n[b]2) The fact that it took players so long to figure out how good it was.[/b] Developer Erik Lauer, genius that he is, understood the power of Balance almost immediately back in the Alpha-Beta days (play Moxes, play [autocard]Jayemdae Tome[/autocard], Balance down to nothing), but in general the community didn’t grasp how broken this card was for at least a couple of years.\n[b]3) The card was reprinted multiple times, through [i]Fourth Edition[/i].[/b] Either Wizards didn’t understand just like players didn’t understand it, or they did and wanted to keep printing it until it was proven broken.\nTo point number 2, I vividly remember the day Balance was restricted (along with [autocard]Fork[/autocard]) in April 1995, as this crazy dude Darryl Markowitz that used to play at the University of Pittsburgh Student Union was running around screaming about it. “The card is totally fair! It just makes things even! It’s even called ‘Balance!’ That’s just ridiculous!” Of course, Darryl was typically balancing multiplayer games down to zero creatures and zero cards, often after sacrificing [autocard]Rukh Egg[/autocard] to [autocard]Diamond Valley[/autocard]. Let me tell you, it was hard to beat decks with four Balances, even in multiplayer.\nIt’s possible that we could print a card with this effect again, although the playtesting would start with a cost something like [4WW].",

But white's primary strength is its enchantments, and Balance leaves those alone.  It also doesn't touch artifacts.  This means it is relatively easy to tailor a deck around Balance.  The real strength of the card, however, is its ability to destroy land.  Balance is a centerpiece in many White Weenie decks, because those decks rarely play more than two or three lands at a time.  Your opponent will not be able to cast best spells when landlocked by Balance.",

I want the name \"Balance\" back to use on a card that is just this strong but never in an unfair way, one that cannot be cheated to give its caster an advantage but which does counteract even the greatest advantage of his opponent.  The fact that it could be broken with Moxes is hardly proof of anything, but I'd rather lose Moxes and keep this (which is what the Revised and 4th Edition designers did).  However, cards like Rukh Egg and Diamond Valley are fun, so they demonstrate why this execution of the effect couldn't work.  If you replaced \"sacrifice\" with \"exile\" and made a few similar tweaks, you could bring this card back as a two-mana stop sign against rush decks, and I'd be very happy.",

      "content": "@ Aaron:\nI love Balance as this card proves that R&D doesn't understand the meaning of balance or the (un)balancing nature of [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard]. \nDestruction is never fair, especially when it includes lands as well, since usually you [b]pay[/b] to play a creature. Therefore, you've [b]earned[/b] it and there is nothing inbalanced about it. Likewise, if a weenie deck with a few lands plays against a fattie deck with many lands, it's [b]fair[/b] that the weenie deck will have less lands and hand cards, but more (weaker) creatures.\nTherefore, if someone plays a Balance or Wrath of God, the only thing he wants to achieve is an inbalance in his favor. First of all, because you decide when to play a creature and when to cast a Wrath of God (f.e. to gain card advantage when you have casted fewer creature spells). Second, you plan your deck by \"wasting\" a card slot for a Balance. So you hope that this card would acieve a goal.\nSo neither a Wrath of God, nor a Balance is an act of balance. The latter might feel a bit more balancing, since it includes hand cards, but enchantments and artifacts are ignored and that's the point where the problems come from. A combo deck or counterspell deck has nothing to lose when adding this card.\nThe funniest point however is that I pray since my registration that white should have less destruction spells and more bounce effects. If you compare [autocard]Evacuation[/autocard] and [autocard]Day of Judgment[/autocard], which one feels more balancing, which one could be abused more and which one feels more white flavored (peaceful)?\nSo once R&D would recognize this and really choose to do this color-shift, you'll see that an [autocard]Upheaval[/autocard] is a better balance than the [4WW] version, Aaron suggested.\n(And this would bring us to a mono-white [autocard]Worldpurge[/autocard] and a white [autocard]Time Reversal[/autocard]). I still have hope.",

Today you have to anticipate the damage and pre-emptively put a damage prevention in effect.\nIt's easy if we talk about spell stack. You play a [autocard]Drain Life[/autocard] targetting me and in response I activate my COP: Black. My damage prevention anticipation resolves and waits for the next black damage which, if the Drain Life resolves next, is the Drain Life and It will not damage me.\nBut it's totally different thing with combat. You attack me with your [autocard]War Mammoth[/autocard] and I want to kill him. So I block it with my three [autocard]Drudge Skeletons[/autocard]. Let's say that I have three untapped [autocard]swamp[/autocard]s and [autocard]Circle of Protection: Green[/autocard]. Under old rules you stated how you distribute your damage and I responded with damage prevention and regenerations. So if you hit one skeleton with all three I regenerate the skeleton and prevent the damage from me, if you take two skeletons, I regenerate them and prevent the one damage and if you take all the skeletons , I regenerate them all.\nSo no damage to me and three skeletons alive.\nUnder the new rules I have to anticipate how you'll be distributing the damage. So I can regenerate all skeletons and have no mana to prevent your trample damage, so you'll hit only one skeleton and I suffer 2 points of damage. If on the other hand I regenerate two skeletons and put a damage prevention for green effect floating, you can hit the skeleton wich isn't regenerated and it'll die.\nSo I'm down two life or one skeletons.\nThis was improvment in the rules?",

Nobody likes to lose what is theirs, especially when they paid for it.\nI could see some interesting ante variations, however. Ante could work in a \"common pool\" format, where everyone chips in a large pile of cards that become common ownership, and people then make decks out of those cards. So, \"losing\" a card to ante wouldn't really matter since the card pool is owned by the group anyway.\nOr, maybe some format where the ante card lost is still owned by the player, but he just cannot use it for the rest of that tournament.\nAt any rate, this card is absurdly powerful in any format that allows ante - wow!",

It can't just be that they simply enjoy other methods of play, depending on the situation (possibly including Ante, when consented to by all players), because there is only one right way to play the game, and that's your way. And only wusses would ever mulligan, or let an opponent mulligan, because the only acceptable way to play this game of strategy is to gamble on the games, and then allow chance to skew the results to an irrecoverable degree. Anyone who has any opinion other than this single view is clearly inferior.\nWhile we're at it, lets do away with those silly ban lists, restricted lists, the increased minimum deck size, and most certainly that four-copies-per-card limit. Constructed deck restrictions aren't what Magic is about, after all, and that surely holds true even with modern cards, because the game hasn't massively changed over the years at all, right? If my opponent can't beat my deck of 40 copies of [autocard]Chancellor of the Dross[/autocard], then they deserve to lose on turn zero and lose a card permanently, to boot.\nAnd what's with all these different formats, and card rotating out, huh? Eighteen years ago, no cards had rotated out, and that's the way this game should stay forever, no exceptions. All cards ever printed should be usable in all contexts, and there should never be divergent rules systems that must be balanced in distinct ways, often by disallowing certain cards or altering fundamental rules of the game. The only thing that these different formats do is give new players the impression that there are numerous acceptable ways to play this game, all of which can be enjoyable in different ways, for different reasons. We don't want them getting that wrong idea stuck in their heads. Then they might even commit that most atrocious crime of failing to be informed on an outmoded rule referenced by very few cards, and done away with in the earliest days of this game, from before when many of the newest generation of players could form whole sentences.\nGood job, you've successfully changed the mind of a random stranger on the internet by ranting about their inferiority due to having tastes that differ from yours, and now that person is just as closed-minded and bigoted over a card game as you are. Don't you feel oh so very satisfied?\n[i]{/sarcastictrollrant}[/i]\nYour true friend and convert, \nSummer Glau",

      "content": "Although others have already replied to SlackWareWolf with decent rebuttals, I feel like I've got to add my 2 cents, being that I was there, back in the days he writes about so much.\nI started playing Magic before the game was even a year old. Legends was brand spanking new and in all the gaming and comic book stores. Friends passed around \"spoiler\" lists (as we called them) that described all the cards already in existence - without those, you wouldn't even have known what was already out there. Arabian Nights and Antiquities were the only other expansion sets released so far. Revised Edition was new; Unlimited Edition was already sold out. Alpha Edition Black Lotus had gone UP TO 40 dollars when in mint condition. I remember thinking about how ridiculous that was, that someone would pay forty bucks for a piece of cardboard. :-)  The easiest way to become familiar with the Alpha/Beta/Unlimited cards (still my all-time favorite set) was to own the Collector's Edition box set. That was a wonderful thing to have; it was like a minature art exhibition in a little box. I had one sitting on my shelf for years and would pick it up once every couple months and spend hours engrossed in the lovely art from this era, the Golden Age of Magic.\nAnte was still in existence at this time, as SlackWereWolf says, but it was already well in its decline, even before the end of that illustrious first year of the game's existence. Most players opted out of ante, both in casual play and in tournaments. You could often find someone willing to play for ante if you really wanted, but it was much easier to find people who DIDN'T want ante games.We just didn't want to risk losing our cards, and we felt uncomfortable about playing competitive games that involved gambling, especially with complete strangers. After all, what do you do if the guy you're playing with loses a round, but refuses to hand over his ante cards? The situation could get ugly pretty quick, and we were all aware of that. In my gaming group we all heard a story about a guy who lost a Mox Ruby in an ante match, and in a fit of anger, bent the Mox in half and walked away. That sort of insult could easily lead to a fistfight and possibly legal trouble. Furthermore, ordinances against gambling were (and still are) commonplace everywhere, which gave the gaming community all the more reason to shun playing for ante.\nI personally did play a small number of ante games between the release of Legends and Ice Age, but only with close friends and family members. We only ever anted up common cards or cards from sealed decks, so it didn't feel to bad if we lost something. I never lost or gained anything besides a couple of commons. We all determined it wasn't exciting to play for ante unless there were high stakes involved, but nobody wanted to take those risks. In the end the vast majority of us players decided Magic: the Gathering was better off without the real-life gambling aspect of ante.\nAnte gaming may have been standard enough to be expected during the Alpha days, but was already mostly abandoned by the time Revised hit the shelves, in spite of several ante cards like Contract from Below being featured in the set. A small number of ante games were played amongst friends during the Ice Age era, but I don't think anybody was still doing ante anywhere when Homelands came out with the final ante card to ever see print - Timmerian Fiends. Ah, Homelands... :->\nAnd that's my story. Hopefully my perspective can help clarify SlackWereWolf's version of history, which is colored by his occasionally aggressive posturing.",

      "content": "Ante DOES still exist.... How is it tht people realize that people do in fact still play for Ante? At my House, we still do sometimes because it's fun. This game was originally played for Ante, and in Revised, there was a Rule Book that came with every Starter Deck, and inside, it had a \"House Rules\" section, which, showed very common House Rules people used, and one of them was that you didn't have to play for Ante because back then it was REQUIRED. Every game was for Ante.\nAnother common House Rule, was a Mulligan. Today that's a standard rule you can use even in a tournament, but back then you couldn't because it was only a House Rule.\nAlso this card is NOT more powerful than Ancestral Recall. I've been playing this game for 16 years now, and I can tell you that one Black Mana is NOT always worth drawing that many cards, you'll deck yourself. Ancestral Recall is worth a crap load of money because it's the best draw spell in the game. This card isn't nearly as good because you have Ante MORE crap. If you don't win you lose not only the game but TWO cards.\nTo the guy who said \"If Ante was still around this would be an Auto Include in every deck\".... No, you're wrong. I was there when Ante was not only common, but you HAD to play for ante. I don't think some of you realize that those little Rule Books that came with EVERY Starter Deck back in Revised, flat out said you play for Ante. You didn't get to say no unless BOTH players agreed not to.\nI realize that today it's the reverse and you have to actually ask if they wanna play for Ante, but back then Ante was REQUIRED to play Magic, and you HAD to Ante a card up. Also, you didn't always turn over the top card, there was Ante where you and the person you played against would CHOOSE a card from your collection, and THAT was the Ante. Also, you could use money too. I used to play for like 5 dollars, or, flip the top card over after a Shuffle, or, you went into your deck and both chose a card you were willing to Ante, or, you could even Ante up a card you chose and the other person did to of equal value.\nSometimes we would also just buy a Booster or Starter Deck, and use THAT as the Ante. Like for example, you'd buy two boosters or Revised, or, a Revised Starter Deck, or a Booster of Antiquities, or Legends, and then your opponent did the same, and whoever won, got to keep the Boosters or Starter Decks.\nAnother House Rule back then was Pizza Ante; Basically whoever lost had to Ante up 5 - 10 dollars towards the Pizza for everyone else. This was usually on a Friday night where everyone was playing at someone's house (I used to host games every week back then) so everyone would come to where I lived, we would all go inside my Mom's Camper, and play Magic all night long, and when the sun came up, got Breakfast and kept going. Whoever lost had to either go get Pizza, or just pay for some of it, like I said, it was common to Ante up 5 or 10 dollars towards the Pizza Bill, and when we got older, Beer money.",

That player may play the card now for [B] or 2 life, otherwise they must add the card to their hand.\"\nMaybe a little complicated, but I like the mechanics of it... It still plays along with the original concept of ante cards... that your opponent gets the card.  It's just that now we're looking at it in terms of them getting the card for this game only instead of for permanent ownership.  It gives your opponent a really big chance of having a huge payoff.  For a measly [B] if they have it, or 2 life if they don't, they can play whatever you gave them immediately... [autocard]Emrakul, the Aeons Torn[/autocard] anyone?  Can you imagine your opponent just handing it over to you and knowing you can cast it for such a measly price?  Lands and low CMC cards might not be worth casting right away, but you gain ownership of them.  It's a gamble for the player playing Contract from Below... they might give up something low cost and it isn't that much of an advantage to their opponent... or they might give up their biggest card and make it really easy for the opponent to play it against them.  It's a nice concept, I think... \nExcept that if you're playing with any card that reveals the top card of your library you can make sure you don't play it until the top card is something you have no problem giving up.\nIn that regard, this card would still be massively overpowered.\nOh well.  I tried to come up with something.  Maybe there's another way, but I thought the idea was interesting at least.  Anybody got a better way?",

It doesn't force your opponent to risk even more cards, all you are doing is risking another of your own cards in the hope that what you draw will win the game.  Yes you will most likely win the game after using it, but it's still a risk.  If you win, they only lose the card they might have lost anyway even if you didn't play this card; if you lose, then you lost another card and that's the risk you take when you play the card.\nSure the effect is way overpowered, but considering you're risking losing ANOTHER card for it, it needs to be a big effect.

This aura has a very black feel to it.  Not only does it have a black feel to it, but it would probably have suited black better.  Blue's removal tends to send things back to players' hands - not to their graveyards, making this card a bit suboptimal.  You could enchant a creature with this and then ping it to death with Prodigal Sorcerers and Pirate Ships, but that probably means the creature has a low toughness, and Creature Bond isn't going to do much damage.  Otherwise, you'll have to rely on your big creatures to kill off theirs (Siren's Call might help in this).  But Creature Bond is best paired with black and efficient creature removal.",

It can't just be that they simply enjoy other methods of play, depending on the situation (possibly including Ante, when consented to by all players), because there is only one right way to play the game, and that's your way. And only wusses would ever mulligan, or let an opponent mulligan, because the only acceptable way to play this game of strategy is to gamble on the games, and then allow chance to skew the results to an irrecoverable degree. Anyone who has any opinion other than this single view is clearly inferior.\nWhile we're at it, lets do away with those silly ban lists, restricted lists, the increased minimum deck size, and most certainly that four-copies-per-card limit. Constructed deck restrictions aren't what Magic is about, after all, and that surely holds true even with modern cards, because the game hasn't massively changed over the years at all, right? If my opponent can't beat my deck of 40 copies of [autocard]Chancellor of the Dross[/autocard], then they deserve to lose on turn zero and lose a card permanently, to boot.\nAnd what's with all these different formats, and card rotating out, huh? Eighteen years ago, no cards had rotated out, and that's the way this game should stay forever, no exceptions. All cards ever printed should be usable in all contexts, and there should never be divergent rules systems that must be balanced in distinct ways, often by disallowing certain cards or altering fundamental rules of the game. The only thing that these different formats do is give new players the impression that there are numerous acceptable ways to play this game, all of which can be enjoyable in different ways, for different reasons. We don't want them getting that wrong idea stuck in their heads. Then they might even commit that most atrocious crime of failing to be informed on an outmoded rule referenced by very few cards, and done away with in the earliest days of this game, from before when many of the newest generation of players could form whole sentences.\nGood job, you've successfully changed the mind of a random stranger on the internet by ranting about their inferiority due to having tastes that differ from yours, and now that person is just as closed-minded and bigoted over a card game as you are. Don't you feel oh so very satisfied?\n[i]{/sarcastictrollrant}[/i]\nYour true friend and convert, \nSummer Glau",

However, if you are about to lose your card from Ante, you can, at ANY time, during ANY match, simply Concede, and take your crap and leave.\nWhen you play for Ante, you can ALWAYS concede and not lose that card. In fact some cards that are Ante cards, actually SAY right ON the card, that the opponent may concede instead of losing their card. PLEASE remember that....\nSo, let's take a minute to remember:\n1. Playing for Ante back in 1993 and 1994 was REQUIRED. You could not \"NOT\" play for Ante. The only time you could decide not to was if you and your opponent BOTH agreed not to play for Ante. Those were considered Casual Games.\nHouse Rules said you could instead PICK cards to put in the Ante. You could ALSO Ante Boosters and Starter Decks or even Money. I've done all three.\nIf you started a game for Ante, and you saw the card you had to Ante, and didn't want to lose it, you were always OK to say \"I can't lose this card, I'm going to concede\" and just stop playing. You could ALWAYS do that. I have like 10 Rule Books from everything from Unlimited Starter Decks to Revised and even 4th and 5th Edition, which taught you how to play. You could simply concede at ANY time, and not lose your cards. Just the game.\nIf you lost a card to Ante, it was common courtesy to offer to trade that card back for something else.\nBut not once were you required to lose your cards if you were not OK with it. I can't remember which card it is, but basically, it says \"If the opponent does NOT concede, you exchange ownership of this and that card, this exchange is permanent\".... You could just concede and keep your card.",

My mom's favorite card was Demonic Hordes.  For the longest time, though, only I owned a copy.  She would get very mad whenever I'd bring them into play.  Like most players, my mom was very much against land destruction (especially since it was hers that were getting blasted).  One time, however, she was ready for me.  Or at least, she thought she was.  When I played my Demonic Hordes triumphantly, my mom kinda smirked a little.  That was uncharacteristic, I thought.  Usually she pitched a fit when I brought the Hordes into play.  Next turn, I found out why.  [autocard]Control Magic[/autocard].  My mom stole my Demonic Hordes!  For a few painful moments, I was quite distraught.  Then I remembered something.  My mom had no way to pay their upkeep!  I didn't mention it until her next upkeep, and she had to read the card closely about twelve times before it finally sank of just how bad a play she had made.  But my mom is anything but a poor sport, and she didn't ask for backsies or quit the game.  She just suffered the consequences of the upkeep until she was dead.  Don't feel bad for her, though.  My mom later got some Demonic Hordes of her own and proceeded to kick my butt with them on many occasions later.",

If your opponent has any mana outlets at all (Dragon Engine, for example), you'll get the bare minimum.  Drain Power is more effective for denying your opponent the ability to cast later spells.

You can of course add the Power 9 to it, which makes it even faster, but not everyone can afford that so I wanted to find a way to win on the first turn without expensive stuff.

The Blue Ward, as I recall, was on an [autocard]Order of Leitbur[/autocard], and I remember my opponent telling me that I couldn't target the Order since it had protection from blue.  I smugly pointed out that I wasn't targeting the Order at all, but the Blue Ward enchanting the Order.  The game didn't end so good for me.

If your opponent has a particularly annoying creature that you'd like to eliminate via Hurricane or Earthbind, you could even use Flying Carpet on his creatures.  By the old rulings, this would also destroy your Flying Carpet, but sometimes it was worthwhile to do so.

My opponent's choices often made this easy for me.  If the Shade got blocked, I'd pump it up just enough to kill off their blocker (and/or keep the Shade alive), then use the remaining mana in my second main phase to cast more creatures.  If the Shade didn't get blocked, sometimes I wouldn't bother pumping it up at all to leave more mana to play bigger creatures/spells.  Other times, I'd pump it up as big as I could get it to inflict as much damage as possible on my opponent.  Frozen Shade also taught me about timing.  Many new players (myself included) would cast spells like [autocard]Giant Growth[/autocard] and activate abilities like Frozen Shade's before even declaring an attack.  It took including the Shade as a central theme to my deck to realize just how foolish this strategy was and how much more effective waiting was.",

When I first saw one, it was in a casual game at school, and I thought it was some impressive rare.  My eyes grew wide as I beheld the woolly white beast my opponent had just played. \"What is THAT?\" I demanded.  \"Uh...\" my opponent replied incredulously, \"a Hurloon Minotaur?\"  So then I read the card and realized it was only a crappy 2/3.  I had [autocard]Hill Giant[/autocard]s bigger than that thing.  Why was that a rare?  Then I remembered I'd asked myself that same question about [autocard]Lifelace[/autocard] and [autocard]Underground Sea[/autocard].  Wizards of the Coast was so retarded.  It wasn't until a few months and about a dozen Hurloon Minotaurs later, that I discovered it wasn't rare at all.  Or even uncommon, for that matter.  I'd just been lucky enough not to get any.  But it would still be a while before I'd discover that Underground Sea should never be put in the same sentence as Lifelace.",

But he was a great card to get in my first starter pack because I remember just staring at the art and reading the flavor text and thinking about what type of amazing new world this was. It provided a few very specific details (the hymns, the tattoos, the carved horns, the misty breath), but also left so much to the imagination (what weapons he used, the terrain, their society, the meaning of the markings, who they fought and why) that it acted like a spark to jump start my imagination. I created a world in my head from these first few cards. The game didn't need to provide tons of detailed characters or a complex plot or spell out every relationship between every faction. They provided a wonderful, mysterious, open setting and let the player fill in the rest. The sense of mystery and possibility of opening cards early in the life of Magic when I was about 13 was just one of those magical moments of youth.",

And while red has Mana Flare to pump out huge Earthquakes and Fireballs, green has Llanowar Elves, Wild Growth, Birds of Paradise, and Channel to pump up its Hurricanes.  Be careful with the last two, however.  The Birds will be doomed once the wind starts whipping, and you might be doomed too, considering that a Channel-fueled Hurricane will result in you taking loads of damage.",

There's a certain irony to the way the developers approached this in Magic's early days, considering cards like Ancestral Recall.  But in their thinking, a one-time use spell like Recall wasn't as dangerous as an artifact like these that could be used again and again.  Today, we laugh at such imbalance, but to be fair, the developers had nothing to compare it to.  It took years and years of research and play-testing to achieve the level of sophistication and balance we have today.",

The main problem with the Warlord is that there are more reliable options for red at the 4 casting cost slot.  In a typical duel, the Warlord isn't going to get much bigger than a 3/3 or a 4/4, and most of the time he'll be even smaller than that.  If you're looking for a big red creature, check out Fire Elemental, Earth Elemental, or even Stone Giant.

Now days an enchantment that only does one simple thing ike \"firststrike\" would be silly to play as it is basially just giving the opponent a card when they kill your creature, but when this card was played there wasn't a terrible amount of removal, and firststrike was a much stronger ability. But because its so weak not i have to bump it down....2 out of 5",

And I appreciate the simplicity and modesty of the art for such a brutal card. No silly face of someone getting hit with it. And it was never without a target. A key consideration for any creature back in the days of Revised and Fourth Editions was whether it could be killed by lightning bolt because every red deck played it. The only thing wrong with this card is that it was played so much.\nIn my early years of playing, I often wondered if the best deck in Magic might be solely Mountains and Lightning Bolts. Fast mana would help if you had any, but probably wouldn't be needed. \nI also love the simplicity of the presentation on this cycle of \"one mana for three effect\" cards: no flavor text, no clutter, no complex rules. Just simple effects that didn't need to be explained or justified with flavor. Normally, I'm a big fan of good flavor text, but in this case, less is more. The streamlined presentation just fits with the fast, direct nature of the spell. And by not attaching some mage's name or motive to the effect through flavor, it allowed the player to assume more ownership of the spell and apply more imagination to how it was cast and why. And on a card that was played [i]this[/i] much, any flavor text would just get old and overdone. \nWhen my friends and I first started playing, our favorite cards were simple. We avoided powerful, but complex cards such as [autocard multiverseid=\"1216\"]Power Sink[/autocard] or just about anything with tiny font, because we didn't really understand how they worked.\nRed has always been my favorite color ever since I started playing Magic in Revised and this spell may be a big reason why. I wonder if designers today could resist the urge to crowd this card with more \"action-packed\" art or flavor text from their favorite planeswalker.",

Your adversary is probably not going to waste a Disenchant on Living Artifact played on one of his own artifacts, but you can bet he'll do what he can to destroy the artifact (and the Living Artifact along with it) if it happens to be played on one of your artifacts.Relying on your opponent to play artifacts is bad deck design, and casting it on your own artifacts is asking for card disadvantage.  Also, you can never actually net gain life with this card unless you have more than one of them in play.  Living Artifact is neat, but something like Wooden Sphere is actually more reliable.",

It defined a core ability of green that has been replicated countless times and inspired numerous variations. It also made a statement that this was not your classic Tolkien fantasy world or D&D elf. This world of Magic was wilder, scarier, more alien, darker and stranger than your typical medieval fantasy setting. I remember as a kid I did not like the art. I had never seen a pale, fierce, tattooed, fanged elf with goggles like this. But I grew to love the distinct flavor and originality. This card made you feel that this was a truly original world and you never knew what strange things you might find in each new pack.",

Early in Magic's history, green established itself as the color of the mana ramp, and Llanowar Elves was the enabler.  Green also had Birds of Paradise and Ley Druid, but the Elves had an advantage over the Birds because they could attack for an occasional point of damage, and an advantage over the Druid because they only cost one mana to summon.  Finally, it had an advantage over both because it was common, and just about every kid could get his hands on four of them.",

Like Goblin King and Zombie Master, Lord of Atlantis had the unfortunate downside of affecting ALL merfolk in play, and not just your own.  Back then, lords didn't bestow their bonuses on one another, which meant the only creatures Lord of Atlantis could pump up within the set was the lowly Merfolk of the Pearl Trident.  At least Goblin King had Mons's Goblin Raiders AND Goblin Balloon Brigade.  But Lord of Atlantis was blue, which meant easy access to Phantasmal Terrain or Magical Hack, ensuring that your islandwalking fishfolk would be able to stomp your opponent rather easily.",

Lord of the Pit (and [autocard]Demonic Hordes[/autocard]) defined Demons as having a downside attached to an undercosted threatening body, and that blueprint has served us well over the years for making fun, flavorful cards; even though most players would rather not have drawbacks on their cards at all, Lord of the Pit and friends have made such drawbacks feel natural and like fun deckbuilding challenges.\nThe other noteworthy topic on Lord of the Pit is its well-recognized art and artist. Mark Tedin is the one illustrator that has been working on [b]Magic [/b]cards more or less continually since the very first set through today. He has a distinctive style that fit in well with both the iconographic early [b]Magic [/b]art as well as the painterly masterworks on most modern cards.\nMark is local to the Seattle area and stops by the office a lot, so it was fortuitous that I bumped into him at the coffee stand earlier this week and got to ask him about his inspiration for Lord of the Pit.\n“I wanted it to look not like a Balrog,” he told me. “It was called ‘Balrog’ when I got it, but I wanted to make something that didn’t look ‘Tolkien’.”\nHe then went on to explain the glyph in the corner of the art: “I was doing a lot of work on [i]Talislanta [/i](an RPG WotC was producing at the time), so I wanted Lord of the Pit to look like a book illustration of a demon, like something from a tome,* so I put that little glyph there. I met a fan at a convention that had gotten a tattoo of that symbol, and he showed it to me and asked me what it meant, and I said, ‘I have no idea!’” That is one trusting fan!\n*: I found this comment interested because I have never stopped to think what a Magic illustration was supposed to represent in a meta-sense. Is it supposed to be a photograph of something? An illustration by someone in-world? A movie still?",

      "content": "@ Aaron:\nAfter I have commented other replies from \"Random Card Comment\", I want to repeat myself here once.\nThe Lord of the Pit is an icon, a symbol... that's true. But his real status was always ignored due to the fact that black is the color of creature sacrifice, but was [b]never ever[/b] the color of creature hordes (production).\nTherefore the god of evil was combined with white protection or green token mechanic & mana acceleration. Only rarely, it was combined with Thrulls, the underwhelming [autocard]Breeding Pit[/autocard] or [autocard]Sengir Autocrat[/autocard]. The ever-present [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard] was also a big problem. \nBut what I really liked in your post:\n[i]Lord of the Pit (and Demonic Hordes) defined Demons as having a [b]downside[/b] attached to an undercosted threatening body, and that blueprint has served us well over the years for making fun, flavorful cards; even though [b]most players[/b] would rather not have drawbacks on their cards at all, Lord of the Pit and friends have made such drawbacks feel natural and like fun deckbuilding challenges. [/i]\nSo where do you get your \"most players\" from? Did you specifically ask players? Did this fulfill the quality standards for a realistic poll i.e. different ages, gaming styles? Or is it more like a manager decision in hope for an agreement from the target audience. \nDon't you think it's a kind of answer that players tend to focus on highlander or limited formats??? What do you think is the reason? In our group, we have switched too, including even more restrictive forms like star, pauper, etc. This is mainly because Magic has become plain, simple, stupid & repetitive. And this is mainly because of the lack of drawbacks. So if the cards don't give us the drawbacks, we will find some in form of gaming formats with drawbacks/restrictions. THAT'S the reality... not your so called \"user request\".\nAs for the [autocard]Lord of the Pit[/autocard]:\nI always wrote that black should be the color for creature based mana acceleration (like [autocard]Llanowar Elves[/autocard]) and I never understood why green should be the only color to be able to cast their iconic creatures without being FORCED to add another color for mana ramp. If any color can have creatures with flying, draw spells or search spells, why shouldn't it be possible to give each color a unique way to accelerate greater amounts of mana? \nAn Akroma in a pure white deck makes much more sense and is much more flavorful than adding artifacts or green.",

With such a powerful ability as doubling the mana produced by lands, giving your adversary this edge can be quite dangerous.  With that said, the very fact that this is red makes it worth playing.  No color is as dangerous when boatloads of mana are floating around.",

Even without Stasis or Winter Orb, this could cripple an opponent's tempo.  Cast during your opponent's upkeep, and they probably wouldn't be able to play any spells until their next turn.",

      "content": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #54, 1/10/10[/b]\nThis very printing of Meekstone was the first card to awaken my inner Johnny oh-so-many years ago. I went out at bought/traded for four [autocard]Savannah Lions[/autocard], four Meekstones, and four [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard]s, threw in the [autocard]Kismet[/autocard]s I had, and fleshed it out with other small creatures, [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard], and [autocard]Disenchant[/autocard]. I even had a couple [autocard]Holy Strength[/autocard]s that could either go on my Serras or be used to lock down opposing 2-power guys with Meekstone. In my primitive playgroup, it was pretty annoying. I didn’t even have [autocard]Icy Manipulator[/autocard]s; they were out of print and pretty hard to get at the time.\nDesign-wise, Meekstone is a fine card that holds up even today. It is costed aggressively, and it can either be used as a deck centerpiece (as I did) or as a metagame safety valve. Of course, we’ve reprinted it relatively recently ([i]Seventh Edition[/i]) to little fanfare—the card is kind of passé at this point and doesn’t excite anyone very much anymore. But I decided to prod the developers about the possibility of reprinting it anyway.\nReactions were mixed. Yes, it is appropriately costed and does interesting things, but the prevailing opinion was that it disincentivizes behavior that doesn’t exactly warrant strong punishment—the use of large creatures. So unless there’s a big need for it in a future constructed metagame or we find ourselves with a plethora of rare slots in a set and no great way to fill them, I doubt you’ll be seeing Meekstone reprinted any time soon.",

While I do find that aspect of the game rather challenging,  I would offer my observations based on a particular style of deck, as well as the specific deck that I have constructed, in that style.  One of my favorite, and long standing designs, is a \"Necromancer\" deck.  It contains many ways to throw things (HUGE THINGS  TERRIBLE THINGS, WITH UNSEEMLY MANA COSTS!!), into my graveyard, and bring them out again, at a fraction of the cost to \"hard cast\" them.  After a turn or two of tearing my opponents to shreds, I find that my reanimated minion becomes fatigued, and so I Sacrifice it, to play two or three more spells, bringing onto the field at least two creatures that are just as incredibly dangerous and costly, while still having a little mana left over to fling a Doomblade.  Under these very specific circumstances, this spell is extremely effective, and I recommend it most highly.  Also, as it is an interrupt, if you have a Pestilence in play (or similar pumpable ability/power), than you can even hold off on using the spell until combat, and then, depending on your opponent's strategy and spells, you may have the opportunity to Sacrifice a creature who was already going to die, and do no damage to your opponent, and turn them into fuel for a dangerous activiated ability of your choosing.  Thank you for your attention.  :-)",

Notice they're all Flying. Notice, too, that, despite green being the 'creature color', I haven't mentioned any creatures for it. Two green creatures that [i]might[/i] deserve mention would be [autocard]Elvish Archers[/autocard] (which would suggest mention of [autocard]Savannah Lions[/autocard]) and [autocard]Craw Giant[/autocard] (who was released in '94 in Legends and in '95 in Chronicles - around the time of Revised and 4th).\nAnyway, interesting thought. I think that, as the original poster suggested, either Serra Angel or Hypnotic Specter would receive the most votes in such a poll ... and probably Serra Angel. Whether or not she's [i]actually[/i], mechanically, the best creature in early Magic, she's arguably the most iconic creature of early Magic. That is, she's the most well-known and most-respected, on the whole ... and was probably the most-played.",

And I love that it gives no hint at what is causing the fear because it is only in the victim's mind. Even the background is an utter void as everything fades out of consciousness until all that is left is the indescribable panic that completely overwhelms the nervous system.Oh yeah, and a great card that goes in every black deck, blah, blah, blah... powerful instant-speed removal, yadda, yadda, yadda...",

You can force them to take damage by making them discard cards with the Rack, but all you need to do is play Black Vise by itself to make it work.\nThe Rack is fine in a discard deck, but I wouldn't consider it a stronger card in general than Black Vise.",

      "content": "This is the only site that I have found where everything matches what I have for this card; artist, version and script. Here is the rub ... I got this and several other \"revised\" and \"unlimited\" cards at GenCon, MECCA in Aug of 1993 where and when they were given to me but I know that they were not for sale until April, 1994. I know I have the right year because Wizards only had 3 or 4 small booths, not the \"half arena\" they had thereafter, the year MidiMaze refused to work, Dactyl VR came out and BattleTech pods made their debut at a \"buck a minute\".\nThe cards were given to me by a Wizards Rep (wish I could remember the guys name) and promoted as a \"new card game that I had to try out with my friends\" and \"will be the best thing since D & D was invented\". \nQuestion??  Does this add value to the cards or just add value for me?? Our family has fallen on some hard times and as much as I know I will regret it, we are considering selling this and others such as Mox Jet, Time Vault,etc..\nMurph",

Frankly, Underground Sea s the most expensive of the ABUR dual lands, with good condition Underground Sea being worth about $155 a piece. PSA graded ups the value considerably, and while Tabernacle is definitely in the ballpark of two Revised Edition Underground Seas, I think there's less demand for PSA graded Tabernacles, which at the very least makes a comparison kore difficult. All in all, if your Tabernacle is in good enough condition for 8-10 then I'd say it's fair. If it's lower, then your friend is right. It's a lot easier to move an Underground Sea at the price you want than it is to move a Tabernacle.",

The third thought would be that the redirected damage would be just that, normal damage to the bodyguard and would not be in the form of a counter at all. unless of course you gave the bodyguard himself infect with and aura or equipment somehow. \nI think that it would most likely be done in the form of -1/-1 counters but it has me wondering.",

So, 2 out of 5 stars for it's playability today, one star for nostalgia, one for art, and one for the flavor text.",

Water Elemental is one of the lowest, if not THE lowest, and it lacks the drawbacks of a lot of other creatures.\nSome may say this has seen its time, but I think a 5/4 creature in a deck laden with things that give flight and knock blockers out of the way with unsummon has its place.\n4/5",
