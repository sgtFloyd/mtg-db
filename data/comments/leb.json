Games are very different yet are kind of similar in a way. This conundrum has a second clause: (Prerequisite: each player untaps their stuff at the beginning of each turn and draws one card each turn- you knew that)\n[i]A player must invest a card and/or the untap of a creature/land (all of which are henceforth deemed 'resources') to subtract the other player's cards and/or life total.\nAt the smallest amount of 'resource', a unit of 'resource' either subtracts from the other player's cards or their life total.[/i] Remember that I am speaking on the fundamental levels. The same goes for adding cards/life to you.\nMagic is so cleverly and beautifully designed with the interactions between cards; and so the card game is indeed a card game. With the previous two clauses we have the last:\n[i]Each of your cards are necessary to for you to win. Same for the opponent. All cards are lost/neutralized when each player has each card. So there forms a synchronized cycle between both players. Everything evens out.\nIf you were to Ancestral Recall to get to your cards faster/sooner than your opponent, you would have an unmatched Cloud Sprite or an additional Unsummon, ultimately causing you to win.[/i]\nAnother way to phrase above is that the Ancestral Recall drew into your (addition) Island, Cloud Sprite, and Unsummon that are necessary to win.\nSo, people beg the question, [b]which card won you the game?[/b] OR [b]which card is better?[/b]\nIt is a divine mystery. The [autocard multiverseid=\"83282\"]Storm Crow[/autocard] trollers may unknowingly speak an ancient truth.\nI personally belong to the religion of card draw, for it does not matter whether or not your library has the cards to win unless you draw into them.",

Thinking especially about Lord of the Pit, Shivan Dragon, and Serra Angel.\nIt will be very difficult to keep them in-flavor, make them 'dressed to impress', and ALSO avoid making overpushed designs like Baneslayer. But if I can do it, I think the 're-vamped' cards could be aMAZing.\nSo in regards to Armageddon--I think it is actually a card that would be ok to leave almost as is. The effect can be a game-winner, can even be back-breaking, but is not particularly vicious: i.e., there are many options that you can use to play around it, including countermagic, tapping all your lands in response to play a big red burn spell, or hoping you developed your board enough to win anyway.\nChange from 3W->3WW or 3WWW. and I think it's not that bad.

Often, it's worth the risk, and sometimes, it's just fun to include cards like this in a multiplayer game for hilarious moments.  (A 2-Headed Giant with both players running black?  4 of this, please.)  It's also rare altogether to see a black anthem that's not tribe-specific, so this card has a lot of versatility.  An all-around solid card.\nNow, about the art.  Some people might vote it down for the silly-looking face on the moon, but I think it adds a ton of character to this card.  Other that that little detail, the art is very simple and straightforward, with a nice aesthetic provided by the creepy trees on either side and the silhouette of the mountain range underneath the cloud-covered sky.  While those aspects of the art are pleasant, what really makes the card stand out in the art department is definitely that subtle but oh-so-important detail of the moon's face.  It ties in with the title of the card, and it gives the card more personality.  I personally like it very much, as I like the card as a whole.\nFINAL RATING:  4.5/5",

A card as (in)famous as Black Lotus really needs to impress to live up to it's reputation, and a less-experienced player could easily overlook it as a card that 'just produces mana'.",

If I didn't lose my arm strength in exchange for MTG skillz, I'd punch him in the face until he got that THIS IS SO MUCH FREE MANA THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING TO COMPARE THIS TO. [autocard]Geosurge[/autocard] is the only somewhat-comparable card I can think of right now, which provides a bonus of 3 mana... on turn 4, in monored, with restrictions. This does the same on turn 1, in any deck, no restrictions. You wanna play that [autocard]Phyrexian Obliterator[/autocard], but you have a [autocard]Swamp[/autocard], [autocard]Island[/autocard], [autocard]Plains[/autocard], [autocard]Forest[/autocard], [autocard]Mountain[/autocard], the Obliterator, and this in your hand? Go ahead, hell do it TURN 1. Madness. This is worth AT LEAST 1k. BUT, I do think it is overpriced, as I would never pay more than 60$ for a card, and $3000 for a card restricted in Vintage? Meaning I have to buy 55 other $100+ cards? No thanks, I'll pass.\nFinal: 50/5. The. Best. Card. In. The. Game. With the possible exceptions of Ancestral Recall or (I'm gonna say it, don't hurt me please) [autocard]Jace, the Mind Sculptor[/autocard], SOLELY because if you had a deck with only land and Lotuses/Recalls it would suck but a deck with only lands and Jace could at least survive a bit longer.",

Not to imply that this card isn't all sorts of game breaking, just that it might not be the absolute best.There is one advantage to this card over either of the previously mentioned cards, however. This card can be useful in virtually any deck, as opposed to Recall or Walk which are both blue exclusive. Regardless, all three are considered Power 9 for a reason.An obvious 5/5. Anyone who rates it less doesn't understand the game.",

      "content": "Force of Will is the Magic reason why many people who think this card is overrated.....ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. \nThe reason why it is so poweful is it's ability to enable such stupid possiblities as:\nTurn 1: Swamp, Dark Ritual, Dark Ritual, Buried Alive (3 Phyrexian Obliterators), Dark Ritual, Entomb (4th Obliterator), Dark Ritual, Living End. \nYeah, that's a legit move in Vintage. And there are so much more reliable way to completely destroy the heck out of someone on Turn 1 than 'JUST' four Phyrexian Obliterators.\nSo, for Combotastic Potential, it LOOKS like it's worth 5 stars, right? Well, if you made a whole class of par-excellence cards worth 5, then yes. But it is not worth '5.1' stars- i.e. it's not the best card in the game.\nBecause there IS a situation where it's a dead draw- the part of the game where you can't combo out.\nIf your combo is stopped by anything, Black Lotus becomes a dead card, because the normal 'pro' resources: drawing cards, extra mana, extra turns: stop being good as the natural, instinctive Timmy resources: Attack points, bodies for blocking, life points, or at least spells that create more damage/life loss/attack points in some way.\n It doesn't affect the board. You shouldn't NEED anything else if you draw it in your opening hand, but if you are in the mid- to late- game because someone Force of Will'd you, and you draw this, you might well be thinking you'd rather have drawn something else- Time Walk in an otherwise 'dead' game is at least '1U: draw a card', and gives you the chance to draw something that can actually win.\nMake no mistake, for sheer Potential, Black Lotus outstrips every card in the game- but the 'every deck, every situation, no drawbacks' thing people keep going on about? that's not true-\nbecause this is why we have Blue. Blue gives even Black Lotus a drawback. \nbetween Ancestral Recall and Time Walk, Recall gives more cards for less mana, but Time Walk does so much more than just draw cards for only 1 additional mana, especially if you have permanents of any kind out.\n1. Time Walk- useful at any point in the game\n2. Black Lotus- it DOES go in any deck, useful in the early game for making sure there's no late game.\n3. Ancestral Recall- Time Walk is more worth splashing Blue for, since this can sometimes feel like Black Lotus. drawing cards with no mana to play them is like having lots of mana with no cards to play, and it's not colorless.\nThese 3 cards will be the topic of Magic debate for pretty much ever. Accept that a consensus will not happen, and that people's Top 3 will be in different orders. But these are the Big Three, period.",

I see a lot of people comment on these kinds of cards with \"what were they thinking printing this?\" or \"It's totally broken any way you look at it, surely they would have seen that when making the card.\" The answer lies in the very simple fact that the game was new. The main reason why this card and the Moxes are so good is because we are comparing it to all other 14,000+ cards in Magic. Back when the game first started it wasn't as much of a big deal of having 3 mana on turn 1 simply because the options of cards to play were so limited.",

The color ward cycle can best be examined as artistic interventions against the oppressive humor archetype, whereas the unappealingly desperate musings of Dan Frazier's eponymous series are truly indebted to Jenny Holzer’s oeuvre. Or, as Baudrillard and Guillaume so succinctly state, \"What is produced with the romantic turn…is…the…play of…masculine hysteria…of …sexual paradigms that once again must be reinserted in the more general and universal context of a change in the paradigms of otherness.\"",

In such peculiar cases, Alpha's common language might still help as reminder text, but just won't do it for such an elaborate game anymore because it's not distinct enough once there are card interactions.\nIt still does basically exactly what was originally inteded with \" [i]If Cyclopean Tomb is destroyed, remove one token of your choice each upkeep, returning that land to its original nature.[/i]\"\nI'm [i]pretty[/i] sure back then they didn't plan that you could still [autocard]Stifle[/autocard] this ability, say, twenty turns after it went to the graveyard (long after it could remove any more mire counters), though :D\nThis ability is very uncommon or at least something you wouln't find on newer cards of this sort (that change particular array of permanents in some way) anymore. Instead of just 'disenchanting' all permanents that were influenced by it when it at once gets destroyed (e.g. like [autocard]Corrosion[/autocard] - which again is a pretty old card by itself).\nYet Cyclopean Tomb slowly 'renaturalizes' only one each turn, which is the main reason for the confusing wording you need now in order to go with the rules that have become far more complex since Alpha.\nThe part with \"[i]remove all mire counters from a land that a mire counter was put onto with Cyclopean Tomb but that a mire counter has not been removed from with Cyclopean Tomb.[/i]\" is just making sure you can't pick a land during your upkeep that you already picked and doesn't have any counters left so by choosing it you could make sure other lands keep their mire counters forever.",

Under the early rules of the game, a creature's type consisted only of the entire phrase after \"summon\" on their text, not the individual words of that phrase, so Goblin King didn't affect himself.  (Notice how the original wording doesn't say \"other goblins\" -- that was added when he was changed into a goblin in the grand creature type update, as the rulings on him note.)This was a huge problem for early goblin decks, since they had searchers but couldn't use them to search up the kings.  It also meant multiple kings wouldn't buff each other; now they do.(Thankfully, goblin chirurgeon could regenerate non-goblins; it only require a goblin to sacrifice.)",

[X] can be any part of that creature's casting cost, including 0.  Colors in the casting cost may not be paid with inappropriate mana.\nIf a creature played face down with illusionary mask would deal or receive damage or be tapped, turn it face up and pay the remainder of the casting cost or sacrifice it.\nMy interpretation of what this card is meant to do:\nLet's say you are playing green.  You have this mask.  You have three green mana available.  You play a [autocard]Sedge Scorpion[/autocard] and two [autocard]Leatherback Baloth[/autocard]s as face-down 2/2's all for [0].  Next turn you have four green available and you state that you are attacking with a face down pair of the 2/2s (a baloth and a scorpion).  Chaos ensues.\nWizards.  Feel free to use this idea.   Honestly, I think that this artifact could have a casting cost of [1] and be perfectly fair.

I mean, I started playing D&D/AD&D back in 81, so I got that if you summoned a demon and screwed around with it, you'd die. No cacodemon spells here. And when I didn't die, but used my summoned fiend to crush my opponent? All was right with the world.This card isn't about what is better and what is worse. This card is about, well, this card.

      "content": "A qucik FYI for those who don't know...\nMoxes are power people, I've used them all, even before the restricting rules came out. Why are the moxes powerful? well on their own each mox is a boost for speed mana, which is powerful (not broken) what makes them broken is using all 5 in the same deck, plus those newer ones Diamond, Opal and the Chrome.\nit's like playing 4 lightning bolts, you draw 1 and bolt the guy he's at 17 (still alot of life) you play another from your opening hand he's at 14, the more bolts the more effective the resault. The same goes for Moxes,  when your opening hand is..\nMox Emerald, Any land, Mox Diamond, any other land, Wheel of Fortune, (and 2 whatever cards, could be counterspell and Force of Will)\nyou drop a land, drop the Emerald, drop the Diamond and ditch a land, tap them play Wheel\nYou just hosed your opponent, they discard 7 and you both draw 7 new cards.  At this point you've only played 2 moxes out of 8 (1 copy of each in the deck plus a Lotus) what are your chances of drawing more? pretty good, you can also draw more draw cards like Timetwister, Windfall, Memory Jar, Ancestral Recall plus you could be playing with Lotus Pedal, Dark Ritual's and such for even more lightspeed mana.\nMoxes are called power for a reason. And for anyone wanting to say \"oh those opening hands don't happen\" guess again, rare opening hands were when we didn't do anything broken on the first turn.",

Is there some thing I don't about that explains this wierd phenomenon?I can see Ruby JUST BARELY maybe not making it, since the only places it's legal in don't really need it thanks to Simian Spirit Guide, Lotus Petal, and other things that cost less than $200. Like Basic Mountain. I mean Ruby is fine, great, sure...but also probably the least practical Mox.The Four Point Nine club is full of mainly stupidly broken cards like Mana Drain and Mind Twist. I was actually surprised to see Necropotence made it, looking at the other 38 cards I was left with. But Blue is supposed to be the Best Color right? so why is Sapphire not a 4.9 in any printing?",

I don't hate cards for being expensive or over powerful, you just have to realize the power level of each card and say, \"I don't have the money to make a deck like that\" most players realize the unfairness when building a deck that costs $15 vs $500. the difference in price should indicate just how much more severe one deck is than the other.",

For one lousy mana you can tap an annoying creature, and forcing the opponent to pay four mana each time to untap it is quite a lot. Not to mention your opponent faces a difficult decision: your opponent has to decide whether to pay four mana or not, before he draws a card in his turn. So if he pays four, he might not have the mana to play whatever he draws.Sure, if an opponent has 10 or more mana or so available, it doesn't do that much. But still, I think it's a nice card.",

It's on the other side of Red and Green and thus were designed to be more passive and controlling. Psionic Blast is one of the exceptions where planeswalkers could do direct damage to kill a creature or opponent. Combine with other blue control cards, PB is very dangerous, compare to Char is already in a damage-abundant color. Last but not least, there are also way fewer creatures with protection from blue than red.",

(Green, Red)\nThe Development reason for the rarity is for Limited's sake, and because the effect \nis quite powerful, but a staple for deck construction, so Mythic isn't right.\nThe converted casting cost is 3 because Wizards deems that is where Cancel should sit, \nbut the extra line of text makes all of these about twice as powerful as Cancel.\nThe Creative reasoning that allows Vorthos to get his head around multi-colored countering is that\neach color has Wizards. The Wizard creature type, like Humans, is something that they all have in common, even though Blue Wizards are much more common. Wizards throw around brightly colored \n'fireworks' spells all the time, and countering is the best thing I know to represent that.\nQuestion: Does anyone think these cards would see play at 2CC? Or is that too much to ask because of the conditionality? At 2CC, they might be o.k. at uncommon....\nThe only thing I worry about is that this cycle might be THE perfect 'Hate' cycle, so good it renders other concepts for Hating obsolete. Question: Is that necessarily a bad thing? Although the entire Alpha set has finally rotated with the removal of Giant Spider from M12, I think the original idea of having some cards be constant, perennial classic mainstays of the game is a good one.  \nIs this too egregious a breaking of the color pie to be allowed, or do I make a decent case that this could be something to consider? Perhaps not in Standard...but what about future Planechase, Archenemy, or Commander decks?",

This was probably the way it was intended to play when the card was designed but it was resorceful Magic players that found ways to manipulate it; at first using series/stack tricks with the way extra turns were taken to take their turns before the skipped turn and later using untap ability tricks to take unlimited turns.\nI really hate \"preventable combos\" and Time Vault along with Flash are two preventable combo cards I wish they'd errata correctly so they don't have to be banned because of turn 1 and turn 2, two card combos.",

To be Power Nine you have to be:\n1) Completely utterly undercosted for your effect\n2) Actually broken in Tournament play, so that Banning and Restricting in one or both Eternal Formats makes more than just sense- it sounds like the only way to keep the formats healthy.\nCards like Bazaar of Baghdad and Library of Alexandria have been hotly debated as possible \"Power Tenth\" cards.\n3) The final requirement to be really accepted as Power turned out to be: Must be from Alpha, and have the full prestige of \"Developers were all on coke back then\" assumptions as the only sorry excuses for its existence.\nThere is more consensus that Time Vault is actually legitly a Power Card than any other card not in the Original List than any other, which is where I decided that people are giving extra weight to 'is from Alpha' from. It took Timetwister's place, and no matter HOW GOOD Timetwister IS and IS KNOWN to be, it was once a POWER NINE card, and has lost that highest place in MAGIC player's eyes, and now will forever have to deal with that affecting how people evaluate it, resulting in it being downgraded to be thought of as \"Wheel of Fortune but Blue\" RATHER than Wheel being \"Timetwister but Red\".\nThe next time any of the 5 Moxen or Black Lotus or Ancestral Recall or Time Walk get a call saying \"Sorry, we don't think you're THAT great anymore because of this guy\", you will have your answer to which card has had more impact than Time Vault. Jace, the Mind Sculptor is nowhere near close at all, he's practically a joke. \nMANA DRAIN is a joke when you set THAT kind of bar.\nATTENTION WIZARDS: STOP MESSING WITH TIME!",

If you have, how can you say that they are the exact same thing, because they have totally different effects? And also if you have not read hte cards, you also should not be able to claim that they are the same thing. The only similar thing is that both make all players draw 7 cards. Wheel makes them also discard their hand before drawing, whereas Timetwister doesn't discard anything (matters for example if Megrim is in play) but all players shuffle their hands and graveyards into their libraries, so the main idea is graveyard recursion.",

I spent many a first turns droping a blue dual and two moxes, or a mox and a sol ring or Mana Crypt or whatever, I then cast Twister refill my hand and possibly do more right away with other moxen floating around, at worst case I drew force of wills, counters and drains, I still had control.\nat 2U to cast Timetwister can ruin someones day, I remember watching an opponent mulligan his hand down to 5 cards to get his combo in his hand, so I Timetwistered and he folded, true story.",

I'm not sure if thats why they are called the p9, but it explained the reason why they are often mentioned as a set of cards, why this card is included and why a card like [autocard]wheel of fortune[/autocard] is not. \nAll decks that include p9 have dual lands and all of them splash blue (for the p9, [autocard]force of will[/autocard] etc), so including timetwister over the functionally near-identical wheel of fortune (graveyard recursion in a 0-4 turn format is rather meh), makes a lot more sense.\nWhat it does, is refill your hand AND disrupt the opponent's hand in a format where doing either of those in the first two turns is as game breaking as taking an extra turn or getting a 0 mana artifact out that produces mana. Read Pontiac's comment.\nThis card deserves its status. They may be cards that individually could beat it ([autocard]library of alexandria[/autocard] springs to mind to me), but no other card is an auto include as fast as this one, except ofcourse the rest of its mythical set, Power 9.",

In fact, you have the potential to find yourself in a worse position than when you started.  \nBlack Lotus, the moxes and Time Walk all benefit you without your opponent having any chance of benefiting more from them more than you.  Ancestral Recall is almost always used by its caster to draw cards rather than forcing his or her opponent to draw cards, and so it basically fits in the same boat as Black Lotus, the moxes and Time Walk.\nBut what about Timetwister?  It not only has a higher mana cost than the others, but it's the only one of the Power Nine that could potentially put you at a significant disadvantage to your opponents.  \nMany players value not having to take chances when they don't have to, and I believe Timetwister adds unnecessary risk.",

(as of this writing, 10-04-2013)\nYes, we're all kindered spirits here. I wonder if we ever met at a Magic tournament at some point in 1994-95.\nI had the old Collector's Edition set during my younger years, and I spent hours entranced by the artwork. I was particularly stunned by the artwork for Kev Brockschmidt's Verduran Enchantress. It was cards like that which drew me into the game. There hasn't been any art in M:tG with that kind of beauty in a great while. Yes, while looking through this Collector's set, I could tell by the amazing artwork, and the graceful way the cards interacted with one another, with the sensible, down-to-earth wording, that I was going to really enjoy this game. For me, the Alpha/Beta/Unlimited edition will always be true Magic.\n@ LateralisOne - you're not the only one who didn't like the \"Pokemon Star-Trek\" style change that came with Mirrodin. At the time when I saw them, I thought to myself \"I'm glad my days of paying money for Magic cards are long over\".\n@ SlackWareWolf - I know what you mean. Mid 1994 is when I got into the game, and I noticed that the cards actually *smelled* quite nice back then. I never opened any Arabian Nights boosters, but did open several Antiquities and a good bunch of Legends and Revised. I recall that Fallen Empires boosters smelled kind of bad, and some people on the old Usenet even commented that the bad smell could have contributed to the set's unpopularity. A funny thought... but who knows. :-)",

When Green (nature) does battle with water, it is sometimes sucked up into tree roots, or into the ground. But sometimes when weather (an early domain of green) gets involved, \"killing\" water will result in ice.\nIn other words, this is the green equivalent of a zombie; a perversion of one of its enemy's threats turned against them.\ndjflo- somewhere along the line, Green lost its domain of \"weather\" except for windstorms ([autocard]Hurricane[/autocard], [autocard]Arashi, the sky asunder[/autocard]... [autocard]windstorm[/autocard]). [autocard]Tsunami[/autocard] is a green card because it is a powerful natural force, rather than a literal attack by water. \nNowadays, this would be blue - [autocard]wall of frost[/autocard]. Blue has assumed control over ice completely. Green no longer perverts the enemy's corpse. Black has assumed control over reanimation. White has some reanimation spells, but they all have flavor indicating that it's actually a sort of rebirth, or return to life. The very, very rare time green gets reanimation, it comes in the form of [autocard]reincarnation[/autocard].\nThe color pie is much more defined today, and also much more restrictive. Back in Alpha, any color could be justified doing anything. No lie.",

It didn't do too badly, either. \nGetting off an Incremental Blight or Incremental Growth would be entertaining as well, as would any of the plethora of mass targeted cards out there... it's like playing a mini- My Wish Is Your Command, a fun little slice of Archenemy without the hassle of having to know more than one person. \nThough, to be fair, you could probably get this effect with any of the blue and/or red target-changing spells, like Swerve. In that regard, this isn't exactly \"broken\". But, frankly, the flavour alone makes it too entertaining to pass up.",
