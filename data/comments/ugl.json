That's what the rules say, don't look at me; I blame those lazy bums at R&D.\"And it does have great synergy with Atinlay Igpay, since in Pig Latin, almost everything rhymes anyways (if you can speak it, that is).",

      "content": "Is this the dragon's maze of DRAGON'S MAZE? Time will tell...\nFor confused folks: The card requires you and your opponent to play a game like Simon (that game with four light-up buttons that beep longer and longer patterns for you to remember and enter). At the beginning of each player's upkeep, they repeat all the motions the person before them did, then add another motion. A motion can be either a gesture or spoken phrase.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)\nThe biggest problem with this card (both conceptually and practically) is that your opponent is the first person to make a motion. If they're clever enough to start things off with something really complicated, it can easily be [3UU] for \"At the beginning of your next upkeep, discard your hand.\" The card's only awesome in multiplayer, where you have four or five opponents that could screw it up before you do.\nBut even then, an opponent will eventually figure out that they can say, \"If my name is [your name], then I hereby forfeit this game. Even if this is spoken as part of the upkeep trigger for Bureaucracy, my forfeiture stands.\"",

      "content": "@Dwarf Planet;  I don't know why people have trouble with this card.  Easy enough to translate:\nThere player A, and his opponent player B.  Player A played this enchantment.  During player B's next upkeep, they do action W, which is an action that is a simple physical or verbal action that has no risk of physical or mental harm and can be performed while sitting down.  Let's say for action W player B decides to snap his fingers on both hands at once.\nDuring player A's next upkeep they must perform action W (snapping their fingers) then add another action to this queue of actions that is being built up, referring to this new action as action X.  Let's say action X is saying a tongue twister.  In other words, when it comes to player A's upkeep here, they have to snap their fingers then they say the tongue twister.\nThis continues on, with each player adding to the action queue with each of their upkeeps.  So during player B's next upkeep, they have to snap their fingers and say the tongue twister then add yet another action.  The players keep adding actions during their upkeep after doing all the previous actions in order.  When one of the players is unable to do all the previous actions in the queue during their upkeep, in order, the effect of the card kicks in and that player has to discard all the cards in their hand.\nMaybe it's a long explanation, but if you just grasp the simple understanding of what it's asking you to do, the wording becomes irrelevant.",

First of all, you don't specify players tapping cards anymore, unless you specifically are going to have them \"tap a land for mana\". This card actually illustrates why this is a case... what happens when you use an [autocard]Icy Manipulator[/autocard] on an opponent's card? Do they give it to one of their opponents? Do [i]you[/i] give it to one of [i]your[/i] opponents, since you're the one that tapped it? Does nothing happen because it's not yours to give?\nSecond is that nowadays all control effects are \"foo gains control of blah\". Now, what's the huge problem here? All this reordering totally kills the antecedents... you start with foo, which is... an opponent of controller of the card, but on top of that, it's the choice of the controller of the card which of his opponents it is! The problem is because the controller of Burning Long Name is always the \"you\" whenever text says you, you have fits trying to refer to a choice made by an arbitrary person that is restricted to that person's opponents.\nIn my best guess, and keeping in mind we're making a new \"real\" magic card so we don't have to have it work exactly the same... \"Whenever a permanent becomes tapped, its controller chooses one of his or her opponents. That opponent gains control of that permanent at the beginning of the next end step.\"\nWow, that didn't actually turn out that bad. I guess for completion's sake, the second ability would be \"At the beginning of each player's end step, CARDNAME deals 3 damage to that player unless a nonland permanent they control became tapped this turn.\"",

This means if you roll a double 1 or 6, you can roll again with zero risk.\nThe average value when rolling two dice is 7, and more extreme values are less likely. If you roll a 7, then you will sacrifice Free-Range Chicken on a reroll 1/6 of the time. If you roll a 3 or 11, you'll sacrifice on a reroll only 1/18 of the time.\nIf you roll an even number, the chance of sacrifice on a reroll is slightly less because doubles are possible. If you roll a 4 or 10, the chance of sacrifice on a reroll is 3/36 - 1/36 = 1/18.\nalready rolled an N this turn: chance of sacrifice from rolling another N\n2: 1/36-1/36 = 0\n3: 2/36 = 1/18\n4: 3/36-1/36 = 1/18\n5: 4/36 = 1/9\n6: 5/36-1/36 = 1/9\n7: 6/36 = 1/6\n8: 1/9\n9: 1/9\n10: 1/18\n11: 1/18\n12: 0\nFor the first roll each turn, you'll get a double 1/6 of the time, and those doubles will be evenly distributed between the six numbers. On average, X will be 21/6/6 or 7/12. From a Spike perspective, it doesn't seem to compare favorably with [autocard]Firebreathing[/autocard]!",

This is the same interaction as Ghostly Prison + Alluring Siren.For similar reasons, you cannot force a player to get you a drink in a foreign country.

They say you can concede at any time and even if tearing the card to pieces is a cost, I don't think conceding uses the stack.",

Doesn't really matter, though, thanks to Mycosynth Lattice. This goes a lot quicker if you've got threshold going.\nWhat you need in your hand:\n[autocard]Sky Swallower[/autocard]\n[autocard]Mirrorweave[/autocard]\nOkay so. You start by using Mindslaver to control their next turn. Pass to their turn. From your side, you make nine mana using the infinite mana combo available to your here(tap Simic Growth Chamber, tap Krosan Restorer to untap it, use Freed from the Real to untap Restorer), five of which will be used to flash in Sky Swallower, giving the opponent all permanents you control.\nNow, back to the victim you're controlling. Generate a ton of mana using that combo. How much you need will depend on their deck, so just make a ton. Use Rats of Rath to kill off the Teferi. Now use Feldon's Cane to put their graveyard back into their library. Now, since you have infinite mana, use Staff of Domination to give the opponent a ton of life and to draw their entire deck. Use Fastbond to play all their lands and Mycosynth Lattice + infinite mana to play all their other permanents. Now, since they're all artifacts thanks to the Lattice, have Karn make the noncreatures into creatures. This is why you need that Thran Weaponry tapped, so their lands and other 0 cost things don't immediately go to the graveyard.\nBack from your side, cast Mirrorweave on the Chaos Confetti so that all creatures(which should now be all permanents) are copies of Chaos Confetti. Proceed to rip all their permanents to shreds.",

How long can your hands hold out?By the way, for those confused about the random tap on tap off, back in the day when Unglued was printed and it was still pre-6th edition, artifacts used to not work as a rule while they were tapped. I'd honestly go ahead and say for the sake of original intent and more importantly, fun, you should treat this card as having some sort of Howling Mine-esque errata so it works as intended again. It's not much worse than making those Unglued interrupts instants.",

That's why I always have tokens handy.\nAs for this card specifically, not my favorite Goblin art.",

They’re like Mark Rosewater’s personal proving ground, somewhere he can try things outside of the box that existing rules or product specs can’t handle to see if players like them, at which point the necessary steps can be taken to make them “real.”\nThese tokens are one of the best examples of said experiments. At that point, card-sized tokens hadn’t been included in any product, so Mark commissioned a handful of full-frame art for just that purpose. His layout has not text on it whatsoever, leaving their use open-ended. Later iterations of the printed token, including the ones used for [b]Magic [/b]Player Rewards giveaways and the modern “Tips, Tricks, and Tokens” cards in boosters, built on Mark’s design by adding all the relevant game information that ties them to specific sets and cards--name, type, subtype, power, toughness, and rules text.\nI didn’t buy much [i]Unglued[/i], but I got my hands on several of these Goblin tokens when I bought the Anthologies boxed set years ago. I suppose that product is the great-grandfather of the modern [i]Duel Decks[/i]--it was two sixty-card decks balanced to play against one another, with some token cards added in as nice extra value. What’s old is new, etc.\n[i]Anthologies[/i]: http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_anthologies_productinfo",

What I really hate are cards that put copies of other complex card into play (see [autocard]Mirrorworks[/autocard]). \nSeveral years ago, there were no token cards at all, but we've decided to get vanilla creatures from the core set and give them the role of tokens. [autocard]Goblin Scouts[/autocard] brings in 1/1 goblins with mountainwalk, so we used [autocard]Goblin Mountaineer[/autocard] to represent these tokens. Likewise [autocard]Mons's Goblin Raiders[/autocard], [autocard]Willow Elf[/autocard] and [autocard]Scathe Zombies[/autocard]. The problem was that all these cards have a mana cost and are \"real\" cards. Some cards back then weren't able to handle non-cards aka. tokens (see [autocard]Flicker[/autocard]).\nI would appreciate a solution, where R&D finds a way to allow the vanilla creatures in the core set to represent tokens. Not only would this give those cards some value, it also decreases the need for tokens. My idea would be similar to \"search for  card you own from outside the game\".",
