Maybe Twice. They're supposed to have enough power that that just outright wins. Given that, they are often worth casting 'fairly' (on the 8th or 9th turn) and could still win you the game. Sardia's Untap clause only costs repaying the mana. It basically has \"Echo\". Phyrexia causes you to pay almost half your life (or more than half, probably) just to untap a creature. Damage comes on instants and tap abilities, even old cards and definitely later sets. \nVerdict: Phyrexian Colossus has all the advantages of a Colossus and if you fast-mana him out, he's way way better than [autocard]Juggernaut[/autocard] in Mercadian Masques-Invasion-Odyssey Kitchen Table- but- he is a lot more risky to use than Sardia in \"Whatever's in your Boxes.KitchenTable\" because that life payment is no longer the only way to have a Colossus. \nIf Phyrexian Colossus is like the third biggest creature you own, go ahead and run him. \nColossus of Sardia costs more for more power and safety. In Colossus terms, that means it's better. \nBlightsteel Colossus costs even more, has WAY more power, and is safe from destruction.",

Okay, I know in the first few sets how Black focused more on the manipulation of life-force, and artifacts lack lifeforce (much like enchantments), so they could not be affected.\nHowever, the moment it was clear that Black was the color of Phyrexia - a twisted world of evil artifacts - that restriction stopped making any real sense to me.\nI'm not saying Black should be able to destroy artifacts easily or get a lot of cards that can do it, but still, I think there only about 2 Black cards in the whole game that can destroy a specific non-creature artifact. That just seems odd to me.\nOh, well. This card is hard to use, but very unique, which makes it worthwhile.",

A good card to point out where this would matter is Sensei's Divining Top.Assume the Top is the only artifact in play. World Queller's controller puts his triggered ability on the stack. The top controller has no way of knowing he is going to pick artifact, and has to make a decision of whether or not to put the Top on his library and draw a card. If this card worked the way you describe, Gate's controller would target the top, and if the top's controller drew a card instead, wouldn't have to sacrifice a creature.Not that I think that would be such a bad thing, though. I agree with you. They made Sylvan Library a triggered rather than activated ability. Why not this?",

It's the same reason you can't cast a Counterspell if there aren't any spells on the stack. (fun story there- I once beat a guy with my rebel deck because I never played any spells, I just used Lin-Sivvi a lot.

They are filled with delicious flavour: put your artifact into the hands of some goblins and you've got a 50/50 chance of having them improve it or ruin it entirely (though by looking at the art, you'd really expect them to ruin it).  \nThey are also one of the earliest examples of power creep that I've noticed, considering that [autocard multiverseid=\"507\"]Mons's Goblin Raiders[/autocard] was printed in Beta only 5 months earlier.  Granted, neither of these goblins would be considered strong nowadays, but Goblin Artisans at time of printing did everything that Mons's Goblin Raiders did - and more!  \nAside from their new, more ambiguously-worded ability, Oracle updates have also made these little guys into an Artificer.  Right now that's not a terribly relevant creature type, but for anyone who's curious, it turns out that Goblins are the tribe with the second-greatest number of artificers - [b][i]twice[/i][/b] as many as Vedalken have, as of [u]Scars of Mirrodin[/u]!  It makes goblins feel surprisingly brainy, until you actually look at how many of these goblin artificers are breaking the artifacts they interact with (hint: it's all of them).",

Now it will destroy every card whose [i]first[/i] printing was in Antiquities:\n109.3\nExpansion symbols are no longer a characteristic. Magic cards are recognized as individual game pieces by their English card names. One of the central tenets of that system is that all cards with the same name are considered the same for deck building and play purposes. This system lets us reprint cards, print promo cards, and have cards appear in many languages. But three older cards referred to cards from a specific expansion, and that runs contrary to the system. The Arabian Nights Bird Maiden and the Fourth Edition version should be the same, but City in a Bottle says they're not. In fact, it makes the original version worse!\nSo, cards will no longer refer to expansion symbol as a characteristic. The three cards that used to do this (City in a Bottle, Golgothian Sylex, and Apocalypse Chime) will receive errata in a future update to refer to cards \"originally printed\" in the Arabian Nights, Antiquities, and Homelands sets, respectively). This means that City in a Bottle no longer affects any cards named Mountain. It also means that those three cards can affect cards that were in the appropriate set and then reprinted. City in a Bottle will affect the aforementioned Fourth Edition Bird Maiden.\nReferences to expansion symbol being a characteristic were removed in several other rules as well.",

This will still leave you a game to work with, \nbut not much.\nb) I made it cheaper to cast than Disk so it'd be interesting, and Legendary because it's \nobviously Legendary.\nc) It exiles itself, which is a better way of preventing repeated use than leaving open the possibility \nof making it Indestructible.\nd) I choose destroy over exile because I have a strange Vorthos-sense tingling telling me that that's what it does. Exile and Destroy are not just interchangeable, and the things affected should go to the graveyard. If I wanted to design something that blew a hole in TIME, I'd probably make it exile.

Mutavault, of course, gets played very heavily. Mutavault probably is better in decks that have some kind of theme and can take advantage of the \"all creature types\" part of the creature... but Mishra's Factory is still better and the +1/+1 ability actually gets used more than you'd want to think it would. \nThat's right, Mishra's Factory is generally better than Mutavault and the other creature-lands.

Not like you'd need more than one on the staff, but it's seriously ridiculous. Toss in a creature with a tap for mana ability... you see where this is going. Also fun, equipment shuffles (like shuffling around a pinging artifact to a bunch of weenies, or any number of tap ability equipments). Lots of interesting ideas you could use, so it deserves a 4.",

Well, qualitatively we can still debate that if people want, but quantitatively, busted cards have always had a precedent. :P",
