Your deck needs to be strong at Control, and that's why you are not seeing 'ZOMGSH, [autocard]MISHRA'S WORKSHOP[/autocard] ON A STICK' comments.\nMishra's Workshop is awesome in Fast Decks, this sucks in them. It requires double commitment to Blue to cast and continuous Blue input to work. \nIf this card were really good at what it wanted to do, without being broken, it MIGHT have a chance in Merfolk to ramp out slightly dumb things. But it's not quite even that good enough. We don't see it in Merfolk, the BEST place for a mildly Aggro Blue card to shine. It would not even be that difficult to consistently cast this for just 2 mana in Merfolk. [autocard]Aether Vial[/autocard] just outstrips this by miles though.\nI would put it in a Wizard Tribal deck where the most powerful cards are no better than a C+, but not a Morph Deck because Morph wants to cast a Morph Creature on Turn 3, not play this. If you don't have a blocker on T3 at least, your deck is just going to get clobbered by Creatures. If I gave myself such limitations, I wouldn't feel bad about not using better mana resource cards. :)\nThis will never ramp out to [autocard]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/autocard] except in EDH though, because only in EDH are they both playable. IE in any other place where you might see Arcanis, Apprentice Wizard will just plain get cut for something better. \nLike [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard]. It is a sad fact, but true, because I actually do like this card. :)\nIf this cost {U}{U} to start out with and was a 1/2, it would be able to play the role it wants to play very well!",

You'd use Maze of Ith exactly like 'Dark Sphere, but just better.' Because the corner cases where the cards are 'different', tend to be situations where a completely different type of card, like a lifelinker or a counterspell, would be a better response than this type of permanent 'damage shield that does nothing else'. In EDH, so many of the cases where you'd want this card, totally involve 'an opponent's Legendary Creature General Damage', that Maze of Ith is preferred. \nBut the card is still awesome even though EDH isn't exactly the right format for it! :)",

It's like some kind of weird Blue [autocard]Blood Moon[/autocard] that wishes it was a positive effect. \nThe best card to replace this with is High Tide, but I actually like this one a lot too. :) I mean it's uses ARE pretty abysmal, but then again, Blue ALSO probably really *shouldn't* have such easy powerful color-washing as [autocard]Grixis Illusionist[/autocard] XP I dunno. \nI think I very much like the general flavor of Blue Mana Fixing, and this is one of the earliest examples of it.

Su-Chi would have been seen as an 'equal' card- you pay 4 mana, to get 4 mana.

Antiquities has some great ones, including [autocard]Triskelion[/autocard] who was probably the very best of his day.",

Because Necro skips the draw step entirely, it never begins and you can't choose to skip it. Fun fact: the only other card that has an \"if you would begin\" clause is [autocard]Time Vault[/autocard]. Ponder on that one for a while.\nIf it does still combo, you could use [autocard]Hex Parasite[/autocard] to keep it around, but really, that's insulting to your deck.\n@Ragamander: [autocard]Well of Lost Dreams[/autocard] + [autocard]Parallel Thoughts[/autocard] works, but of course [i]any other way of gaining life[/i] combined with that works better because those don't force you to skip your normal draw. Hell, [autocard]Angel's Feather[/autocard] would be better than this.\n@orisiti: Throw in [autocard]Felidar Sovereign[/autocard] for good measure so you can actually win! Provided your opponent is utterly inept, of course.\nI'm going to go ahead and call this card absolutely worse than [autocard]Sorrow's Path[/autocard].

I'd say they're about equal, exotic is just a land and doesn't cost mana, but this can be played as mana acceleration (assuming you want your opponents colors.) I personally only have one deck that would benefit, and it's a creature stealing deck. Something like this could be acceleration until I get a creature with a color based activated ability.Now it's acceleration AND color fixing.",

It's amazing how many of the best beaters blue really has for manageable drawbacks and then powerful counter-burn spells. Not positive mind-bomb will make the final cut; but when you consider that delver + this + spell pierce T2 means you're safe from removal and 6 damage in; it's easy to see why it may go main-deck. Add in a countersquall, undermine, mind bomb, or psionic blast T3 (depending on what you drew) and you'll hit 11-13 damage T3 *with counterspell protection.* Drop Efreet T4 with a mana open for [autocard]Spell Pierce[/autocard] and T5 is an easy win time frame. \nAgain; T5 damage win, in blue, with counter mana open the entire game, with bigger creatures than the opponent could land, all with evasion. \nSideboard [autocard]Winter Orb[/autocard], [autocard]Sphere of Resistance[/autocard], and other control cards that pin down combos; and you should be good to go.

I don't think he's sarcastic, considering he posted something similar on the fifth edition version and said to look at his comment here. I [i]hope[/i] he is, though. The only other way that his comment would make sense is if he's playing a game mode where each player has 5 life, red cards are banned, and creatures aren't allowed to do damage.\nThis card is okay. You can use it just for the damage, in which case its generally a worse [autocard]Lava Spike[/autocard] unless you're in multiplayer. Its a lot harder for blue to take advantage of each player starting with lower life though, unlike red with stuff like [autocard]Flame Rift[/autocard]. Therefore, its best use is probably to discard your own stuff. If you're just trying to reaniimate a big creature, [autocard]Careful Study[/autocard] or [autocard]Entomb[/autocard] are usually better options in just blue and black (you can't really run a mono blue reanimator deck, unless you're using Body Double, in which case a 1 cmc discard spell isn't needed because your deck isn't that fast). The 3 damage you'll usually do to your opponent isn't that important when you're getting out a huge creature turn 2-3, and you'd generally rather have a higher chance of actually having a fattie to discard. It could work in Dredge decks, since depending on your win condition 3 damage could be relevant, but [autocard]Putrid Imp[/autocard] is usually better.",

The set suffered from having too few cards that were compelling mechanically (Check out this quote from the sell text: “Many cards have tempting abilities, coupled with damaging penalties.” Fun!), but the flavor was very distinct and reasonably well executed. In many ways it reminds me of the upcoming [i]New Phyrexia [/i]set in that it stretched the color pie in flavorful way to show how darkness has crept into all the colors.\nSafe Haven has great flavor and mechanics that are unique and costed well enough to be a lot of fun. I made a slew of Safe Haven decks as a younger man and had fond enough memories of it to include it as a “time shifted” card in [i]Time Spiral[/i].\nYou can tuck creatures that are about to die into Safe Haven (although the M10 rules make that play less devastating), put your creatures in there before you cast a sweeper, or just jam a bunch of guys with cool ETB triggers in there for reuse. The slightly more versatile version of this card is [autocard]Synod Sanctum[/autocard] from [i]Mirrodin[/i], but the flavor of hiding inside a one-mana artifact as opposed to a land feels like a downgrade to me.\nIf we were to make a land that did something like Safe Have today, it would have to tap for mana, as that’s a rule we’re pretty strict about not breaking (fetchlands don’t count). I do see the appeal of designing lands that don’t tap for mana, however--some lands are for mana, and some are for hiding in… makes total sense--but the game plays a lot cleaner the more closely we can tie the number of lands you have to the amount of mana you can produce.\nA “fixed” Safe Haven sounds like a great card for a Core Set some day.

      "content": "@ Aaron:Synod Sanctum does not only have the problem of being a cheap artifact, it also  states: \"under your control\". This is essential, once you use temporary \"gain control\" abilities.I really like the fact that this land doesn't produce mana. Similar to a Maze of Ith, this combined a powerful effect with the disadvantage of a missed land drop and therefore a lower mana count. If the land produces mana AND creates an powerful effect, this sometimes feels more like a trick to bypass being a spell. Manlands for example don't really feel like an animated land, but more like some way to avoid counterspells and Wrath of God effects.So if you really add abilities to lands that produce mana, make sure that you either use one-time effects or really focus on the land itself, not the magic you produce.",

He was the cheapest goblin who was tougher than a 1/1 at the time, which made him one of the few that could survive when an opponent took out your Goblin Shrine. Also, if you had Goblin Wizard, then the green mana requirement was not an issue.But the best thing about this guy, hands down, is the art! Perfectly captures the splash of green flavor with the braids and talismans in the hair, piercings, and war paint. The Dark had some of the best goblin art, before they all had to look the exact same in every single expansion.",

Lands which don't tap for mana have to be pretty special to be playable.2.) It has a mostly irrelevant ability. Sometimes swapping two blockers is awesome, most of the time it isn't. Even when the ability would be awesome, it is something it is pretty easy to play around knowing it is coming.3.) It has one of the most ridicolous downsides I've ever seen on a magic card. Two damage to you AND all creatures you control. This highly limits the kind of deck you could play it in.If this card was printed in modern magic, it would be equally unplayable and apart from being a rare, would be the kind of card you should draft basic land over in the hope that one of your opponents is silly enough to play it.",

I believe it's currently finding printing at Uncommon and soon on it's way to Common status if Commander products continue at the they are, it will likely replace [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard] eventually some year, whenever they decide Sol Ring is unhealthy for the format or isn't needed for every deck. \nThis card has many more analogies in MTG history. \nAlpha was [autocard]Celestial Prism[/autocard], yes, \nArabian Nights did not, I think, have mana artifacts, but I will look them up.\nAntiquities of course is [autocard]Standing Stone[/autocard], and Standing Stones is one of my very favorites from the series. [autocard]Ashnod's Altar[/autocard] is much more powerful.\nLegends has a full cycle of [autocard]Mana Battery[/autocard]s, whose flavor sadly is out of the ballpark but the mechanics suck.\nThe Dark has [autocard]Fellwar Stone[/autocard] at least. (others?)\n[autocard]Astrolabe[/autocard], [autocard]Barbed Sextant[/autocard], and [autocard]Star Compass[/autocard] always come to mind together and I can never remember which sets they're from.\n[autocard]Pentad Prism[/autocard], [autocard]Chromatic Sphere[/autocard], and [autocard]Armillary Spheres[/autocard] also form a family in my mind. \nThere's the 1-mana Artifact Mana Stones, which tend to sacrifice themselves to do something\nThe 2-mana Artifact Mana Sources, which tend to give you the best results because they're narrower, but sharper focused, \nThe 3-mana Mana Stones almost always give you either [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard]-variant or [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard] variant, and frequently come with something very interesting and either abusable like sacrifice or just powerful like Indestructible. \n[autocard]Chromatic Lantern[/autocard] makes me think that people have spoiled by [autocard]Prophetic Prism[/autocard] being so good and they want MOAR. \nSometime around Mirrodin, Mana Artifacts started getting pushed with the assumption that you'd be playing a 3 or 5 color deck and it might probably have more than 60 cards. \nI think I prefer the Artifacts from Ice Age to Apocalypse as being fun, but not too much, restrained enough that it feels like work to produce good mana, but it's work that's possible to make happen, but obviously superior to ancient backwards ways like the [autocard]Mana Battery[/autocard] >P 7th Edition has some nice [autocard]Diamond[/autocard]s in it that I don't recall where they came from. Possibly Mirage. :)",

It can also combo with Reef Shaman or something else that turns someone else's land into an island.",

They get a lot of mentions in literature, including HP Lovecraft's The Dunwich Horror.As for the ability itself... this is deceptively powerful.  Making sure something ends up deader than dead and no tricks can save it is fantastically useful.  Shuts down Undying, Persist (Even Melira-enabled), and of course explicitly turns off regeneration.

It's an old set from a time when most creatures were often overbalanced for there cost.  That being said, it's a 1/1 creature for 1 mana, put on top of that the fact that it's a green 1/1 creature for 1 mana with a pretty decent (and very rare for green) activated ability that stops creatures like River Boa, Silvos and other annoying regeneraters from doing what they do best. That being said, giving this creature flying as a 1/1 for 1 would make it too powerful to the standards of creature balance that existed at that time.  Yes, they could have made it one more mana and given it flying, but I think this creature is more playable as a single mana 1/1 then a double mana 1/1 with flying.  If this were printed today, due to the increase in average power rating of creatures, they probably would have given this 1 mana 1/1 flying with it's ability, but back in The Dark Days (had to had the pun) of Magic creatures, they decided to not give it flying.",

Sure, each turn, you could lose 5 life, but soon enough, it adds together. Take that and add the fact that you can't put anymore lands down, it comes down to who's the most courageous.
