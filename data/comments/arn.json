Now it will destroy every card whose [i]first[/i] printing was in Arabian Nights:\n109.3\nExpansion symbols are no longer a characteristic. Magic cards are recognized as individual game pieces by their English card names. One of the central tenets of that system is that all cards with the same name are considered the same for deck building and play purposes. This system lets us reprint cards, print promo cards, and have cards appear in many languages. But three older cards referred to cards from a specific expansion, and that runs contrary to the system. The Arabian Nights Bird Maiden and the Fourth Edition version should be the same, but City in a Bottle says they're not. In fact, it makes the original version worse!\nSo, cards will no longer refer to expansion symbol as a characteristic. The three cards that used to do this (City in a Bottle, Golgothian Sylex, and Apocalypse Chime) will receive errata in a future update to refer to cards \"originally printed\" in the Arabian Nights, Antiquities, and Homelands sets, respectively). This means that City in a Bottle no longer affects any cards named Mountain. It also means that those three cards can affect cards that were in the appropriate set and then reprinted. City in a Bottle will affect the aforementioned Fourth Edition Bird Maiden.\nReferences to expansion symbol being a characteristic were removed in several other rules as well.",

Alpha, Beta, and Unlimited were basically the same cardset (ignoring the errors in Alpha and the white borders for Unlimited) containing 292 unique cards and 10 alternate arts. Arabian Nights contained 78 unique cards and four alternate arts. This one action could eliminate about 20% of the cards in the game environment. That's not at all 'narrow'.As for the booster draft issue (which, admittedly, is amusing :P), there wasn't really a 'competitive' scene at the time, and limited formats basically were not around yet. And I think the fact that the only basic land in the set is Mountains would cause more problems! (Of course, the mountain wasn't supposed to be there...)",

I can't believe I only just got that).Actually for a while for me personally, the biggest headache came from that paragon of accuracy, InQuest magazine, thanks to their perpetually leaving off the rather important clause of \"except for City in a Bottle\" in their player's guide. I could never figure out how the card was supposed to work if it killed itself! Although InQuest, pre-Gamer, were the ones who told me that the card was inspired by Neil Gaiman's Sandman comic book series. Given InQuest's track record I'm not sure if that was actually true, but I'd like to think so, or at least that Magic drew from the same source as Neil Gaiman did.",

But in a slower control deck, I'd likely go with Spire.I'm not sure I can rate City at a full five stars these days because there's such a wealth of alternatives for decks which can't deal with the life loss, but it's still probably the best five-colour land imo and a solid 4.5",

So he took somewhat thereof in a water-skin he had with him and, throwing it over his shoulder, carried it to the city, followed by a hunting dog which was dear to him. He stopped at the shop of an oilman and offered him the honey for sale and he bought it. Then he emptied it out of the skin, that he might see it, and in the act a drop fell to the ground, whereupon the flies flocked to it and a bird swooped down upon the flies. Now the oilman had a cat, which sprang upon the bird, and the huntsman's dog, seeing the cat, sprang upon it and slew it; whereupon the oilman sprang upon the dog and slew it, and the huntsman in turn sprang upon the oilman and slew him. Now the oilman was of one village and the huntsman of another; and when the people of the two places heard what had passed, they took up arms and weapons and rose one on other in wrath and the two lines met; nor did the sword leave to play amongst them, till there died of them much people, none knoweth their number save Almighty Allah.\"",

That makes it the perfect answer to a combo'd Supergiant Creature (Power 9 or greater). \nThe sad truth is, the decks that Ebony Horse is superior against, are not threatening decks and you really should just play creatures that can win battles or [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] spells.

Some people actually thought Juzam Djinn costed BB instead of 2BB, for instance. Some people around here STILL think the Guardian Beast costed B instead of 3B. Now that's what I call a laugh riot! :-D",

These are in alphabetical order not order of \"goodness\". These are straight hitting power creatures, I didn't bother to pick creatures that were good because of their gimmicky powers like Specters and what not. Apples and oranges in my opinion... Anyhoooooo\n[autocard]Desecration Elemental[/autocard] : 8/8, fear, squishes creatures all day. The only real con here is you can't really play it early or it'll just end up eating itself. \n[autocard]Korlash, Heir to Blackblade[/autocard] : Could be massive. Legendary though so you can only have one in play. Not that you really need more.\n[autocard]Grinning Demon[/autocard] : Basically a stronger version of Juzam. Pound for pound, you aren't doing much more damage compared to what you are taking. \n[autocard]Mortivore[/autocard] : Could be a huge creature. Again though, not something you are playing on turn one. I suppose you can pull some fancy crap and get it out early AND buff...\n[autocard]Mind Maggots[/autocard] : One of the best in the list. You could really bytch-slap someone with this given the right draw. \n[autocard]Plague Sliver[/autocard] : Pretty much the same thing as Juzam, but it's a Sliver so there's really no telling what you could do to it. Of course that only increases the amount of damage you are going to take. \n[autocard]Soulless One[/autocard] : Could be massive. Pretty deck dependent though. \n[autocard]Razorjaw Oni[/autocard] : A bit weaker but the drawback is much easier to deal with. \n[autocard]Waning Wurm[/autocard] : 7/6 disappears after 2 turns. Hot. \n[autocard]Yukora, the Prisoner[/autocard] : Not a bad one. Nothing really happens unless it dies. Legendary though. \n[autocard]Zombie Mob[/autocard] : Could be gigantic. Nerfs your graveyard though. \nSo, in conclusion I'd say there are really 2 or 3  of these that I would take above Juzam. I've been out of the game quite a while though so feel free to flame the crap out of me and post a few cards I should have considered.",

I saw someone point out how it's an un-common and thought it was interesting, but there is a reason. There just simply are no Rares in that set. I remember buying my first Arabian Nights booster thinking \"That's odd, no Rares at all\" but that's how they did it.\nIf you want something REALLY interesting, Ancesral Recall, and Time Walk, were both Commons before Alpha was released. The set \"Gamma\" which was a playtest version, had Ancestral Recall and Time Walk as a common, and THAT is the version of Time Walk that says \"Opponent Loses next turn\". Just a clarify :)",

Black is essentially helpless against enchantments, so it's permanent removal.The card also allows you to counteract Control Magic shenanigans when used on one of your stolen creatures and paired with enchantment removal.  Of course, you could always just disenchant control magic, but this card also works against sorceries that steal creatures (or reanimate from the opposing player's graveyard).  A fringe benefit, but it still exists.I used this card as my main removal in my monoblack Shandalar deck.  Ashes to ashes is an option, but requires two targets and costs five life.",

That would be a kind of rude reason though, I think. (shrug) I also prefer it exiling after resolution (original wording) instead of as a cost (it's already easy enough to stop this card's effect with 'counter target activated ability', so why make it punishable? The Wishes cost less and are more easily copyable (see Isochron Scepter or Panoptic Mirror), making them safer/better alternatives... poor Ring.).(shrug) Ah well, it's their game. ^_^;Actually, you couldn't use it then drive and buy cards. You have to already own the card at the activation of the ability to be able to target it in the first place. Otherwise, said card would not be an applicable target. ^_^",

I have been playing since a time when both consecrate land and Serendib Djinn were being played against me in tournaments and there is nothing about this game that annoys me more than decisions made by wizards employees based nearly entirely on their own ignorance. Wizards would do well to have a specialized team of long time players to ensure that these things stop happening. Whoever has been charged with the task of maintaining errata that is representative of the original and intended use of cards for the past ten years has failed miserably.",

      "content": "The History of [b]Shahrazad[/b]: Part 2 of 3\nOkay, thatâs probably more than you ever wanted to know about the flavour of a card. Yet thatâs just the start of the story of [b]Shahrazad[/b]. Letâs discuss how the card itself has been used (and abused!) since it was printed 20 years ago.\nWhen Magic was first created, nobody imagined what it would become. It was printed with the assumption that local groups would just buy a few cards. There wasnât supposed to be more than one or two of any given rare in the few hundred groups of hardcore roleplaying/hobby enthusiasts that would actually buy more than the starter sets. When Arabian Nights was printed, the game had been out for about 3 months. It was starting to take off, but so far only Alpha and Beta had been printed and the assumption that rares would actually be rare still held. In fact, there wasnât even a â4-in-a-deckâ rule. It just wasnât necessary because it was impossible to get that many copies of a rare. Unless you were some sort of technology wizard, you probably hadnât even heard of the internet, let alone online shopping. If you lived in a major city that actually had a hobby store they wouldnât have even thought to sell individual cards from the game Magic: The Gathering. You can imagine why those who are lucky enough to have those cards are able to sell them for thousands of dollars today.\nSo where does [b]Shahrazad[/b] fit in? Well, it made the card usable. Fun and balanced even. If somebody actually had a [b]Shahrazad[/b] in their deck, they probably just had the one. On the rare occasions somebody played it, it just added an interesting element of diversion to the game. Once the card hit the graveyard, it was probably going to stay there. The players had roughly the same chance of winning the subgame as they did of winning the main game. Of course, every statement in this paragraph became completely untrue as the game evolvedâ¦ letâs go through them.\n[b][i]It made the card usable. Fun and balanced even.[/i][/b] [b]Shahrazad[/b] is the only card outside of ante cards to be banned in every Wizards-sanctioned format. Sure, itâs a weird, crazy card, but why did it get banned? Keep reading.\n[b][i]If somebody actually had a[/i] Shahrazad[i] in their deck, they probably only had one.[/i][/b] On the rare occasions somebody played it, it just added an interesting element of diversion to the game.  As Magic grew, this became completely untrue. People started finetuning decks and collecting multiples of powerful cards. The 4-of-a-card limit had to be introduced. Playing a subgame of Magic once every few games might be fun, but playing 2 or 3 subgames in every game is just tiresome. This makes the most terrifying element of [b]Shahrazad[/b] to the table. If you have more than one in your deck, you can play a subgame within a subgame. This is VERY tiresome. If you thought the film Inception was confusing, try keeping track of 3 (or more!) sets of life totals in a Magic game with multiple copies of [b]Shahrazad[/b]. Itâs not as fun as it sounds, and it doesnât sound all that fun. \n[i][b]Once the card hit the graveyard, it was probably going to stay there.[/b][/i] In the original game of Magic, the graveyard was not nearly as much a part of the game as it is now. Todayâs exile zone is more accessible than the graveyard of those times. Occasionally, a creature might gruesomely be returned from the dead by black magic. But that creature probably got to the graveyard the fair way, by dying in combat. When it came to reusing spells, only the unique green spell [autocard]Regrowth[/autocard] could do that, although the temporal manipulation of [autocard]Timetwister[/autocard] could also do it in a roundabout way. If anybody ever did make a [b]Shahrazad[/b]/Regrowth deck, Iâm sure it was a great joke but quickly became unpopular. 2 or 3 subgames is just tiresome. Nowadays, cards in the graveyard are almost as easy to play as cards in your hand, if not easier. If somebody does have a [b]Shahrazad[/b] recursion deck, you can expect to play 2 or 3 subgames every single turn of the main game. Ugh. Not to mention that it can easily be copied by spells like [autocard]Fork[/autocard]. Thatâs not even considering the possibility subgames within subgames. I shudder to think.",

      "content": "The History of [b]Shahrazad[/b]: Part 3 of 3\n[b][i]The players had roughly the same chance of winning the subgame as they did of winning the main game.[/i][/b] This brings us to a part of [b]Shahrazad[/b]âs history that many players are not familiar with. For a time, [b]Shahrazad[/b] was one of the most powerful cards in Magic. When [b]Shahrazad[/b] was printed, the exile zone hadnât been invented yet. In fact, Arabian Nights introduced the concept of manipulating cards outside the game with [autocard]Ring of Maâruf[/autocard], a concept so radical at the time that they italicized the words âoutside the gameâ on the original card just to show how awesome it was. Then Antiquities brought us [autocard]Bronze Tablet[/autocard], a card so bizarre youâll just have to look it up yourself. Basically, removing stuff from the game was weird back then. Then, after Legends, The Dark came along and made removing from the game a regular thing, but not nearly as prevalent as exile is now. When stuff got removed from the game back then, it was really gone. In fact, if it got removed from the game during a [b]Shahrazad[/b] subgame, it was gone in the main game too. As graveyard recursion and removing from the game became more commonplace, [b]Shahrazad[/b] became not only a nuisance (it was one of the first banned cards) but it also became a powerhouse. As soon as you could resolve a [b]Shahrazad[/b], you could just slowly pick away at an opponentâs library within subgames until their deck was removed from the game. Then you would just win the main game due to the empty library draw rule.\nAnother potential abuse strategy was to use [b]Shahrazad[/b] in a tournament sideboard. You would win the first game of a match as normal, on your deckâs own merits. However, in sideboarding your deck would transform. Rather than trying to win, you would try to drag the game out forever, resulting in a draw for the second game of the match due to time constraints and an overall match win. Sadly, stalling and delaying is still a tactic sometimes employed by more unscrupulous tournament competitors, but [b]Shahrazad[/b] made it absurdly easy and effective. The process of mulligan-taking for a single game alone could eat up several minutes. This potential for abuse is what ultimately led to the banning of [b]Shahrazad[/b] in Vintage and Legacy formats.\nFor a long time, [b]Shahrazad[/b] was up there with [autocard]Contract From Below[/autocard] as terrifyingly powerful cards that would dwarf the power 9, if only they were legal. Of course, with the introduction of the exile zone, cards exiled by [b]Shahrazad[/b] now return to the original game, taking away its extreme power, though not its extreme capacity to annoy. For years most copies of [b]Shahrazad[/b] lay squirrelled away in binders, unused and forgotten. With it being banned in all formats, [b]Shahrazad[/b] would very rarely show up in an actual game, and even then only as an eccentric novelty.\n[b]Shahrazad[/b] has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity lately. For a short time, the card was allowed in the official Elder Dragon Highlander rules. The single-card rule prevented game-within-a-game headaches. The casual tone of the format makes delaying tactics pointless. Furthermore, EDH is the perfect place to use strange and silly old cards. Unfortunately, those in charge of the official EDH rules realized that the average player canât be trusted not to copy and recast [b]Shahrazad[/b] and run games into oblivion, and it has again become an outlaw in all sanctioned formats.\nSo whatâs the situation with [b]Shahrazad[/b] now?  Well, for one thing, itâs valuable. You can expect to pay about $40 for a used one and even more for one in mint condition. Ironically, itâs also much easier to obtain than it used to be 20 years ago. The savvier internet shopper could arrange to have one sent directly to his or her mailbox at the lowest available price in the world within a minute of finishing this sentence. In the rare circles of friends that can resist the urge to ruin games with it, [b]Shahrazad[/b] is even cast in EDH or casual games every now and then!\nI hope you enjoyed reading about [b]Shahrazad[/b]! If you have an interesting story about [b]Shahrazad[/b], if you know something I donât about the card, if Iâve included something untrue, or if youâd just like to chat with a fellow geek, Iâd love to correspond.

      "content": "The History of [b]Shahrazad[/b]: Part 1 of 3\nTo this day, [b]Shahrazad[/b] remains a unique and infamous card. However, few players are familiar with its long and colourful past.  I hope you find the history of this card as interesting as I do.\nIâll start with the flavour of the card. Arabian Nights was the first expansion for Magic. It introduced someâ¦ interesting cards. This is the set that gave us such historical gems as [autocard]Moorish Cavalry[/autocard] and [autocard]Jihad[/autocard]. It also contained [autocard]Aladdin[/autocard], [autocard]Aladdinâs Lamp[/autocard], and [autocard]Aladdinâs Ring[/autocard]. That doesnât seem too odd, until you consider that Disneyâs [i]Aladdin[/i] had just come out on videocassette a month or two before the setâs release! It suffices to say, the paradigm for Magicâs flavour was completely different back then.\nShahrazad is the name of a main character from classical piece of medieval Arabic literature, [i]One Thousand and One Nights[/i]. The spelling of the name itself is pretty interesting. Rather than using the correct scholarly transliteration of the name, Scheherazade, Richard Garfield and the other Magic designers decided to use the same stylized spelling used in the translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton, a legendary adventurer/philosopher known for infiltrating Mecca, publishing the [i]Kama Sutra[/i] in the west, and serving as a captain in the East India Company among many other things. Shahrazadâs role in the story is that of the narrator. After betraying her husband, the king Shahryar, she tells him stories to delay her execution. That is to say, she tells a story within a story, just like [b]Shahrazad[/b] the card creates a game within a game. Also, each story ends with a cliffhanger so that the story never really ends. Doesnât that remind you of how the card works in a game of Magic? If youâre about to lose, just pull out [b]Shahrazad[/b] and play endless games so that you never get executed. It really is an amazingly flavourful card.\nThe art on the card is awesome too! It oozes flavour. It may look a little cartoonish compared to the quality of the cards now, but look at [autocard]Giant Strength[/autocard], [autocard]Celestial Prism[/autocard], [autocard]Word of Command[/autocard], [autocard]Pyramids[/autocard], or most of the cards of the time for that matterâ¦ they didnât exactly have the same standards then as they do now. Now look at that lamp on [b]Shahrazad[/b].The magic lamp story is so overdone that you donât really get to see a lamp used as an actual lighting device anymore, but you do on [b]Shahrazad[/b]! Plus how many other cards have a woman beckoning to you from a bed? Hereâs a final interesting tidbit: tobacco wasnât introduced to Persia until the Europeans brought it back from America. Therefore, since [i]One Thousand and One Nights[/i] comes from long before this, the hookah in the foreground marks the first and to my knowledge only depiction of cannabis use on a Magic card.",

I've tried to deck myself several times, but he seems to always have a Timetwister right on time. Each time I come close to breaking through, another wall is in my path, and he punishes me by playing another Shahrazad. Even when I manage to beat him in the subgame, it's a shallow victory, because this  true game continues.I cannot go on, but paradoxically cannot surrender. It is what he wants. After this long, I cannot allow him to win. I draw my card for turn, and sigh.",

Twin casting this isn't anything compared to someone with 20 Black Lotus in play and a hand full of Forks.\"\nPatently false. The limit of four cards of a name per deck was imposed long before there was even a sanctioned Type 1 format that could have had a restricted list.  Shahrazad was banned on September 1st, 2007, after it had had a long time to exist next to an unrestricted Fork / Twincast. Nobody put them together in a competitive Vintage deck.\nWant to know why it actually was restricted?

So the ideas was get them in so many sub games within sub games that eventually whoever had a bigger deck started winning. Twin casting this isn't anything compared to someone with 20 Black Lotus in play and a hand full of Forks.\nEDIT:\nI saw a lot of people talk about how it's the only non physical movement or ante based card banned in Type 1 / Vintage, which is in itself funny, but, remember, Mind Twist was once banned in Type 1 / Vintage too, because in about 1996 or so, no matter what the finals were for Worlds, entire games were basically decided by whoever played it first.",

The reward for winning the sub-game isn't even very powerful.  Is it really rated highly just because it's freaking weird?  Or maybe it being \"banned in Vintage\" has given some people the idea that, even if they don't see it, it must be an uber-broken card in some way, shape, or form (hint: it's not; it's banned in Vintage because it's a ridiculous card).  I mean, admittedly the flavor of the card is pretty cool, but that shouldn't warrant such high ratings alone.Obligatory link to Hive Mind.",

Not only is that effective for the cost just based on power and toughness, the First Strike will mean it'll probably survive until someone just Path to Exiles the damn thing.Oh, and I have to argue against the statement that this card is the best one-drop that black has; that honor belongs to Will-o'-the-Wisp.

Demons are evil spirits, that you can't see who possess or inhabit one's body and mind versus a devil which is basically another name for satan, lucifer, or haizmann, etc. The devil is a physically mythical creature.

There are 2 or maybe 3. Like, Wizards wanted them to interact like Music scales, almost I think? Faster ones top out with less Beef, Beefy colors start out slower? \nR->W->G->B->U\nthey wanted to have 5 distinct \"keys\" to play in, but really, nowadays we have more like: \nElves/Goblins->R/W Soldiers->Beasts->B->U\nfirst of all, there's a Fast and a Slow way to play Green, second of all Red and White are basically now almost exactly the same speed. They have very similar creatures, thought their spells are very different. \nProbably back then, Wizards struggled with making Green, White, and Red creatures feel different from each other. Today, this elephant would probably just be a 3/3.",

Juzam Djinn was itself a sleeper, I remember when people looked at that card and went \"hmm... I dunno, a 5/5 for 2BB, but it damages you every turn, and doesn't have trample or anything...\" Then soon we all found out what a punisher the Juzam really was, and every black deck had a couple of them. It's amazing no one seemed to ever figure out about the Ydwen. I could tell how good it was, but never had a chance to obtain one.",
