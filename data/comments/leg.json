Andrion's advantage over [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] and [autocard]Air Elemental[/autocard] was that once you got the Cathedral of Serra and/or Seafarers' Quay out, he'd have banding, every turn (not every other turn like with [autocard]Helm of Chatzuk[/autocard], not to mention the banding would be for more than just one creature). Very selective banding, yes, but it WAS within the adventurers' party (q.v. D&D personal campaign inspirations); the Cathedral & Co. were where the adventurers met and formed that party. In fact, extrapolating from the whole situation with Andrion, I think the original intent was that you were EXPECTED to use these lands to create the adventuring party, and thus bring the legends to their intended potential. Very strictly top-down design, but I think the problem was just overestimating how powerful banding was.",

In the same set they printed the Hammerheim cycle of cards -- lands that produced colored mana, entered the battlefield untapped, and had a non-mana ability. Clrearly, the design team wasn't afraid to print lands that were better than basics. \nSo why did this cycle suffer from a lack of a mana ability of any sort? Why not even a tap for colorless? My only guess is that having one would make this cycle too similar to the other bunch of lands. The possibility that they overestimated the power of banding seems just as probable, now that you mention it.",

So stuffing a deck full of different legendary creatures (no immediate downside there other than making poor choices with what works together) is added to when they can all attack as a band....at least that's how it appears to me. If I'm wrong that's fine but I don't really see why everyone rates this card so low.

One of the alternate futures during the time rifts was that Rith's circle had fallen instead, and the five not-quite-as-proud dragons--Intet, Teneb, Numot, Vorosh, and Oros--still flew free. Afterwards, the five still sleep in their tomb shelters, still convalescing, still preparing to come back...The tombs' above-ground sections, meanwhile, contain the insights of Alchor, both his own and those he learned from Intet's circle, and from these in***ions, one can experience immense epiphanies, such that even one's color alignment is drastically changed.",

Stupid reserve list ruining everything.They should've errataed it to suspend so it would work with Clockspinning and the like.  The precedent is pretty clear -- cards like Serra Angel got their ability errated to a keyword once the keyword existed, so they'll interact with (eg) something that gives all creatures with that ability +1/+1 or whatever.Similarly, what this card was originally doing when printed was Suspend, even if they didn't have a keyword for it yet; so it ought to interact with cards that mention Suspend.",

      "content": "@kimbote: There are three ways this could go: the original way, the way a lot of us seem to have been lead to believe they changed it, and the way it actually works now. (For the sake of readability, and in deference to the card, let's say we were looking at \"bands with legends\".)\n1) The original way this functioned was creatures with \"bands with other legends\" could form a band with legends who also had the \"bands with other legends\" ability. Very restrictive. \n2) I was lead to believe that they recently changed it so that it could band with other legendss whether they have the ability or not. That is, a creature with \"bands with legends\" can only join a band if another legend has already been declared part of the band (either because he has banding and was added to the band first, because he was the 1 non-banding creature that was added to the band, or because the band is entirely made of legends with \"bands with other legends\").\n3) However, the current reminder text DOES accurately reflect the rule as written (702.19c). It looks like any number of legends can join a band so long as one has \"bands with other legends\" (which actually makes the ability fairly powerful). It also seems that \"banding\" creatures and \"bands with other legends\" creatures don't get to form cross-bands. When declaring a band you either declare a band of N+1 creatures, N of whom have regular \"banding\" OR you declare a band of N legends, at least one of which has \"bands with other legends\".",

Andrion's advantage over [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] and [autocard]Air Elemental[/autocard] was that once you got the Cathedral of Serra and/or Seafarers' Quay out, he'd have banding, every turn (not every other turn like with [autocard]Helm of Chatzuk[/autocard], not to mention the banding would be for more than just one creature). Very selective banding, yes, but it WAS within the adventurers' party (q.v. D&D personal campaign inspirations); the Cathedral & Co. were where the adventurers met and formed that party. In fact, extrapolating from the whole situation with Andrion, I think the original intent was that you were EXPECTED to use these lands to create the adventuring party, and thus bring the legends to their intended potential. Very strictly top-down design, but I think the problem was just overestimating how powerful banding was.",

Once your opponent has no cards left, they are locked out of drawing any extras anymore. because, it says INSTEAD. If a player has no cards in hand, and then they brainstorm, they get no cards. 0. Then.. yeah they mill top 3 cards. Lets say they Brainstorm with 5 other cards in hand, you discard 3 of them,  leaving them with 2 cards, which they then place on top of their library. then they draw 3 cards, giving them 1 extra card. If they brainstorm with 4 other cards in their hand, they would discard 3 of them, put 0 on top of their library, then draw 3 cards. but basically this removes the point of brainstorming to begin with. When your opponent actually realizes what this demonic thing has just done to their hand they will probably refrain from dumping their hand again. Trick is this will probably discard any counterspells that they have, and then you can launch some more discard spells. it sounds weak but it helps you discard their hand without them disrupting you much more easily, and then when they don't have enough cards to draw any from the replacement effect you have stopped them until they destroy chains. so they will have to topdeck for an answer to it. against [autocard]astral slide[/autocard] this is really funny because they will discard the card, discard another card, then draw 1 card. so it thwarts them too. also, against storm again this completely disrupts storm decks. if you can sneak this into play (it has a low mana cost, so with 1 mana discard spells that 'peek' such as [autocard]Duress[/autocard] very easy to do), you will probably be winning games against the decks that this will wreck havoc on. if you play this with [autocard]dark confidant[/autocard] you will be revealing cards and then putting them into your hand so chains wont affect the card advantage that confidant brings you. its sad so many ppl knock mono black decks because black was fortunate to get enough disruption like this to be really good in a meta.",

At that time, the rule (such as it was) was that a creature with 0 toughness was destroyed, and so it was possible to regenerate it.  Now, usually this didn't make much difference, since when the creature came back, it would still have 0 toughness, and so would just be destroyed all over again, but still, regeneration was possible.  So what happens when you cast a [autocard]Weakness[/autocard] or the like on a Clergy of the Holy Nimbus?  (This was also before the rule that an infinite loop meant a draw).  Well, when a rules judge was confronted with that question, he did the only thing he could:  He made something up.  In this case, the ruling was that the clergy would just keep on regenerating continuously, while steps, phases, and turns ended, stuck on the battlefield perpetually tapped until the end of the game, or at least until the Weakness got destroyed or someone paid for him to finish dying.  Ah, the lawless days of youth.",

It shrugs off Lightning Bolts and is immune to Terror.  A powerful Craw Wurm does not even get to land a single hit in battle, and it strikes down Mahamoti Djinn like a fly.

Most people in the earliest days of Magic run only a single color.

Considering that it was immune to Terror, practically immune to burn, and would kill any of your opponent's creatures while itself surviving, it didn't really matter that you couldn't cast anything else while it was out. And if it did get Swords to Plowshared, well that wouldn't be any worse than losing any other big creature, and you would gain 7 life while suffering no permanent drawback, unlike many other huge creatures which required you to sacrifice something.

The only explanation I can come up with is: someone in design decided that landwalk was too powerful of an effect, and was trying to make it obsolete.",

      "content": "[b]Braid_of_Fire's Card of the Day #4[/b]\nSo this card is the perfect example of why I think classic [b]Magic[/b] is better than it currently is.\nStay with me now.  Usually when people decry the present, it's due to nostalgia or some other irrational sentiment, and while I cannot deny that such contributes towards my perception of the game, I started playing in [i]Dissension[/i] and only in the years since have I been able to go back and drink in the old-[b]Magic[/b] flavor and texture.  \nThis is a card that is more evocative than almost any other I have encountered.  Its art is dramatic and surreal, with a meaningful connection to its name and a bizarre one to its effect.  This disconnect is powerful, though, because it forces the player to ask questions of the game of [b]Magic[/b] in a way a modern card would struggle to do.  Why should I worry about lands being destroyed?  Does the relation of the sun to the Earth really cause such a drastic reactionary response?  What kinds of cards destroy lands?  \nAnd then, what individual lands are worth saving?  Another MTG classic I have come to adore is [autocard]Glacial Chasm[/autocard], which again is a card with a unique effect that makes you want to build around it.  Glacial Chasm also doesn't tap for mana, so the opportunity cost of keeping it untapped to have [autocard]Equinox[/autocard]'s effect available is slight.\nThe thing I like most about this card is that you can open a booster pack and although most will just dismiss its marginal effect or the fact that it's an aura, it provides so much creative space.  This is what Magic, at its core, is about.  And unlike the interesting cards of today, it provides a slight effect rather than a splashy one.  It doesn't provide instant gratification like the Johnny bombs of today have, or even immediate satisfaction when it's used correctly.  If you even counter one [autocard]Armageddon[/autocard] with this, it's done its job.  \nThis is not a good card, but I want to use it all the time.  This card is neat, provocative, and unique.  It's an incredible blend of flavor, atmosphere, and creativity.  There was a day when a [b]Magic[/b] booster held several such cards.  I don't yearn for that day, but I wish I could have experienced it myself as a young player.",

When blocking a single attacker with multiple blockers, if only one of those creatures have banding, defending player gets to distribute the combat damage from the attacker. You can thus combine your creatures to kill a large attacker and send most of the damage onto the wall, having all of your creatures survive. This card can thus be helpful in setting up a creature-defense that is very hard to break through. It would have to be in a specific wall-heavy defensive deck, and such a deck would not be terribly effective. And if you ever won a game with it, that game would be slow and painful for your opponent.

(Also [autocard]Fiery Bombardment[/autocard] if you animate it)\nSo continues my neverending quest to prove that nothing is actually strictly better than anything! (okay not really)\n@everyone: Yeah, yeah, I know. Although in fairness, I usually look at \"A is strictly better than B\" as \"There is no reason to use B in a deck over A\". That excludes things like the Mindslaver situations automatically, and there do exist situations where Deepwood Ghoul would be a better card to use in a specific slot than lotus (example: deck combos off the Ghoul, rendering the lotus much less useful than it). Strictly better, to me, means card B can literally never be included in a deck without card A being a better option (barring bizarre metagame situations like using [autocard]Shatter[/autocard] to dodge [autocard]Mental Misstep[/autocard]).\nI consider this to be functionally worse than [autocard]Goblin War Paint[/autocard]: In your \"average\" deck, and by regular metrics, it is worse. In some (admittedly rare) cases, however, you might have a deck where this is a superior option (any mono-red deck with the Cinder, for instance, should run this instead)",

Well here you go.\nThis card is actually very exciting to me, not because of the power level, but because of what it represents. I love the idea of runes and have long been trying to come up with card designs that represent runes the way I'd like. Of course, I'd want rune cards to be good, so the glyphs don't quite meet the standards I'd make for my own designs, but the fact that these cards even exist is pretty neat. The idea of drawing a rune on a wall seems perfect, and the trap element makes it even better. (It's kind of like a trap, because it's an instant!) This is like deathtouch for things with 0 power.\nOn another topic, I don't like 'real world' flavor text. Why does William Faulkner have anything to say about cards in the Legends expansion set? Did he live on Terisiare? Also, the [autocard]Glyph of Doom[/autocard]'s existence, as we've already determine above, is meant to be a surprise. So the idea that one would \"know [...] he must pass through the wall of oblivion\" is silly; you don't know it's a wall of oblivion until too late. (Also: idea for a new card name.)",

Use Trickery Charm to change your opponent's blocker into a Wall, or use Blades of Velis Vel, Crib Swap, Shields of Velis Vel, Wings of Velis Vel, or Amoeboid Changeling.  Sadly, many of these cards, such as Unnatural Selection, specifically exclude Wall as a choice so they don't work, but this list should be plenty.  Now you can have reanimator in any Green/X color combination.  Since white already has Resurrection and other effects, to be really nuts you'd want to avoid white and make G/U reanimator, which works well with Merfolk Looter types to fill your graveyard and present a tempting creature to block.",

The others are harder to navigate but they also have the most cover and ways to get through undetected. \nMerfolk can easily navigate underwater and slip past any would-be blockers, goblins and dwarves know how to get through caves and tunnels in mountains being able to get through undetected.  Swamps would be easy to hide in under the extremely murky water. Forestwalk could go by undetected through the trees or undergrowth depending on how knowledgable the creatures are to the forest.\nBut how do you sneak across a plains to hit somebody unnoticed? You have to be either extremely sneaky in knee-high grass or be able to move through it fast enough to hit your mark before anything can block, most plainswalkers appear to the the latter.",

If you say \"I'm waiting until its attached, then I'll sacrifice the Eldrazi Spawn\", you'll get the two cards you're after, but it will already be dead the next time you would have a chance to activate a mana ability.  In Magic, its a good idea to remember the rule of thumb \"I cannot sacrifice one creature for two different effects\".  Eldrazi Spawn are good fodder for sacrificing, you just can't use their mana abilities AND sacrifice them to something else.

If a card can do multiple things, it doesn't matter if each thing it can do is worse than another card. Also, I don't get why so, SO many people just combine converted mana cost with activation costs. You pay 4 for Greed on one turn, then you can use the ability on another turn. With all the other cards you noted you have to spend all the mana immediately. Exalted Angel would not have been such a widely used card if it was simply a \"seven-drop.\"",

      "content": "Gwendlyn Di Corci is an older \"popular\" card among magic the gathering players--if anything for her flavor and art. The \"seductress\" of Magic the Gathering, one wonders what her art would be like if it was by Chippy...or Foglio. Ok, enough of those thoughts.\nShe is, in my opinion, one of the strongest \"Grixis\" generals. Crosis is pretty good, but he has to get in a hit to work. Garza Zol is way too expensive for my tastes. Mishra only works well in an artifact deck, Nicol Bolas is way too pricy...Thraximundar and Tetsuo are pretty good, but I still prefer Corci for her cheap cost and hand control abilities.\nForcing a random discard every turn is pretty cool. The fact she is blue makes it beyond cool. Imagine using her with Freed from the Real. Would you pay manau.gif to force a random discard? I certainly would.\nShe is a rogue, so she can be used with prowl, cloak and dagger and a few other tribal rogue cards. Its not the most amazing tribe, but it has more support than \"Human\" or \"Fox\". Although, in the format, Sygg is probably a better choice for a Rogue EDH deck unless you really want red.\nBut Corci's true strength lies in her stats. You heard me. 4 mana for a 3/5 is nothing to scoff at. Its no \"Doran\" or \"Thoctar\", but its kick in the nuts for anyone not paying close enough attention. Most legends with this kind of an ability would be 1/1 or 2/2 at best. Perhaps 2/3 like Rubinia. But making her a 3/5 ensures that when your opponent has no hand, she can still be used as either a fairy strong blocker, or equipped with a few enchantments/equipment and take a few chunks of life off your opponent. Plus you get to laugh when they try to kill her with a Lightning Bolt or Flame Javelin. Since she is an older and underused card, her stats aren't easily memorized and they are rather dull (i.e. seeing her stats takes some extra effort; a decent 10%-20% of players will assume she is just a 3/3 or weaker).\nAlso, she has one flavor text quote that I find rather amusing. Take a gander at\nHandcuffs. Giggity!",

Though most of them are 1-mana, the cycle doesn't have to be exact ports of Fog into every color: there could be interesting changes made to the Blue or Red one, like costing 3 mana, or being more conditional, that they can still form a loose cycle, but give much added utility to the colors while preserving color flavor/identity? \nG: Fog. Should stay the same.\nW: Holy Day. Should stay the same. \nU: Some kind of Watery or Magic Shield. Pretty sure needs to cost more mana. Maybe it can be an Enchantment that gives a pseudo-Fog to one creature? I can see Blue being able to keep one creature safe, less so a whole army. \nB: Darkness. Could be made a sorcery, possibly more effective?\nR: I like the idea of a Fiery Enchantment Shield to be opposite number to the Blue one. \nmake it break the cycle and instead of preventing damage, cause the damage to burn the creature's controller somehow. templating would be",

Also works with Valor Made Real, Mounted Archers, Foriysian Brigade, High Ground, or Foriysian Interceptor if blocking's your thing.",

Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't this only add a counter if you manage to NOT kill the blocking/blocked creature with combat damage?- due to the fact that it only counts if the creature is killed \"this way?\" And your creature has to survive the encounter too. So, as far as I can tell, this card is only useful to a creature that has 0-2 power and survivability, and only for a limited amount of time, once it starts amassing +1/+1 counters.Kind of not worth in in the long run.",

You could not only find numbers like this, but it could be related to Jim Crow laws, US Civil War, emancipation proclamation, civil war battles, death of MLK, death of JFK, Rosa Parks being arrested, you name it. Think of the literally hundreds upon thousands of events that mark everything from Nazi Germany, to Nazis in america, to racism in america, to landmarks in legislation reducing racism.

I don't blame WoTC for being racist, rather blame them for making an insensitive joke, that I also would have thought funny a late Saturday evening talking stupid, childish and idiotic stuff over a bottle of beer.

      "content": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #67, 3/28/10[/b]\nBack in the day, subtypes weren’t always capitalized in rules text, which sometimes made said text difficult to decipher. “Guardians” is capitalized on the subtype line, but not in the rules text. One might guess its rules text referred to any creatures of the type “Guardian” and not just Ivory Guardians. If you look at the Alpha [autocard]Zombie Master[/autocard], you’ll see a similar lack of capitalization on “zombie” in the text box, and we all know that guy affects all Zombie creatures. But other cards in the [i]Legends [/i]set muddy the waters a bit with inconsistent capitalization. [autocard]Blazing Effigy[/autocard] has “Effigy” capitalized, which might mean it isn’t referring to any creatures of the type Effigy (which it was) but rather other copies of itself. If you look at [autocard]Clergy of the Holy Nimbus[/autocard], you’ll see the self-referential “Clergy” in its text box--its subtype was “Priest”--so shortening card names down to a single word was done a lot in that set. But then [autocard]Kobold Overlord[/autocard] speaks of the subtype “Kobold,” which is capitalized… but then [autocard]Adventurer's Guildhouse[/autocard] doesn’t even capitalize “Legend,” the premier subtype of the set. There was no clear pattern regarding whether a word was a shorthand for a card name or a subtype.\nSo what did Ivory Guardians do? A look at its mirror card, [autocard]Beasts of Bogardan[/autocard], doesn’t help, as that card is pretty clear (at least I think so) in that it just affects itself, not other Beasts or creatures named “Beasts of Bogardan.”\nThe answer becomes definitive in [i]Chronicles[/i], when much clearer templating tells us that Ivory Guardians affected all creatures with the subtype “Guardian,” which, at that time, was only Ivory Guardians themselves and [autocard]Guardian Beast[/autocard]. I’m not sure this was anything more than a guess at the original intended functionality, but the [i]Chronicles [/i]printing did set the decision in stone, at least for a while.\nThe Grand Creature Type Revision of 2007 eliminated the Guardian creature type, at which point Ivory Guardians became a Human Cleric--an error that was rectified a year later when they were changed to Giant Cleric. But without a narrow subtype, what were they supposed to do? Pump all Clerics? Hardly. No one would be able to infer that’s what the card did by reading any of the printed versions of it. So the Oracle team reverted them to a plausible interpretation of the [i]Legends [/i]wording, a wording that they still have today: “Creatures named Ivory Guardians get +1/+1 as long as an opponent controls a nontoken red permanent.” Note the use of the term “nontoken” to match original functionality, which cared only that an opponent controlled a red card. That’s quite a roundabout trip for a bunch of Guardians.\nFans of Ivory Guardians may have picked up on the homage we did to them in [i]Time Spiral[/i]: [autocard]Ivory Giant[/autocard]. The link is more creative than it is mechanical.",

It's the vast number of people playing Legacy that such a high price implies that mystifies me.  For me, other Legacy players are like dark matter -- the numbers say they're out there, but where?!When I bust out even the most casual Legacy deck in any of the groups that are nice enough to let me play with them, you'd think I was trying to awaken Great Cthulhu himself from the heat I get. And yeah, competitive Legacy is a thing, if not my thing, but it's a tiny blip compared to Modern and Standard, publicity-wise.",

      "content": "[b]Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day #5, 10/1/10[/b]\nNostalgia is what makes this card at all palatable to me. I have countless [i]Chronicles [/i]versions of this doof filling up some box in my garage, but the [i]Legends [/i]version still has some mystique to it. Yes, I have cast this guy. No, he wasn’t impressive, even to my less-savvy 1995-era self.\nThe way the [i]Legends [/i]set introduced “gold” (multicolored) cards was interesting--they tied the weird mana costs to the brand-new creature type (that would later become a supertype) “Legend.” Each of those first gold cards had two significant drawbacks: they were harder to cast than normal cards, and there could only be one of each in play at a time… heck, for a long time there could only be one of each in your [i]deck [/i]at a time! The modern designer/developer in me immediately wants to counteract those two drawbacks by making awesome cards, you know, like [autocard]Doran, the Siege Tower[/autocard] and [autocard]Dralnu, Lich Lord[/autocard]. But the [i]Legends [/i]folks didn’t do that. THEY MADE THEM ALL REALLY BAD. Well, almost all of them bad, but the point still stands. I mean, look at poor Kei here. His value versus [autocard]Samite Healer[/autocard] is questionable--he costs twice as much in two colors and can’t prevent damage to players. He is flat-out shamed by [autocard]Sanctum Custodian[/autocard]. A [2GW] legendary creature in modern [b]Magic [/b]gets you something like [autocard]Captain Sisay[/autocard], a steady card-advantage machine. Kei is lame-sauce, representative of the whole inaugural clàss of gold cards. Yet people loved--LOVED--them. They had uniqueness, they had flavor, they had awesome frames, awesome names, and some of them had gaudy powers, toughnesses, and abilities (not Kei). Packs of the [i]Legends [/i]set flew off of shelves in hours.\nAs far as the benefit of the rest of [b]Magic [/b]is concerned, gold cards in [i]Legends[/i] were executed perfectly. They got all the excitement a designer could hope out of a splashy new mechanic without using up any of the valuable design space. Truly amazing.\nOf course, what leaves me scratching my head is the question of just how intentional that perfect rollout was. Did the [i]Legends [/i]teams know that they were slow-rolling all that multicolored cards were capable of, or were these their honest best attempts at splashy, powerful creatures? Maybe it’s a little bit of both, but I know the makers of [i]Ice Age[/i], [i]Mirage[/i], [i]Invasion[/i], [i]Ravnica[/i], and every other set that leverages multicolored cards thanks them, not just for inventing the mechanic, but for leaving it so much room to grow.\nAnyway, back to Mr. Takahasi here. Even though his card text is forgettable, he played a notable role in some of Magic’s early novels, although you'd never know it from his lack of flavor text--odd for a legendary card from this set. You can read all about Kei on MTGSalvation’s storyline wiki (http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Kei_Takahashi). (Kei is apparently a “human/eumidian hybrid”, whatever that is.)",

Because of that, hard-core Vorthos would prefer 1 copy of any given Legend from Legends in his deck than 4 copies of Squadron Hawk. \nNormally, the idea that 'Spikes just want to win' and 'Vorthos is just a bad player' is not nearly close to the truth, but for Legends, well that may almost be the case. BUT! there is one major thing that Legends has that no other set will ever (likely) do: \nIt's got the Mega-Super Cycle to End All Mega-Super Cycles in the history of Magic. \n[autocard]Arcaddes Sabbaoth[/autocard]. [autocard]Chromium[/autocard]. [autocard]Nicol Bolas[/autocard]. [autocard]Vaevictis Asmadi[/autocard]. [autocard]Palladia-Mors[/autocard].\nThese 5 cards alone are the greatest cycle in the history of Magic. They spawned an entire format: EDH, which you may know now as Commander. If any of those 51 new cards in the Precons strikes you as impressive, you have Legends to thank for its existence. There have been at least 2 cycles off the top of my head that have been based off of them to my knowledge. \nThey were just the tip of the iceberg. There were 3 addition 'Shard' Legends under each Elder Dragon, and on TOP of that, all the rest of the 2-colored Legends fit into a vast Mega Cycle of Mega Cycles. \nI'm rather shocked, in fact, that not a single Legends card made it into From the Vault, Legends. Certainly one of the Elder Dragons would have made a VERY FINE addition, unless they're Reserved?\nAs a humorous nod to the set, even a 'junk rare' like Hazezon Tamar could have been a pleasant addition.",

Early in the game's history, the idea of green creatures being more efficient than those of other colours existed more in Duelist articles and the like than it did in the actual cards; this was one of the first signs of that beginning to turn around in any serious way (compare Frozen Shade, in a colour where Flying was much more at home).",

[autocard]Chromium[/autocard] appears before [autocard]Arcaddes Sabboth[/autocard]. (White is not the beginning of the Color Wheel). \n2. Grixis appears to be ordered the same as modern useage, but Esper is not. Inconsistent use of {U}, or something else? \n3. Jund cards in the Legends set are not consistently colored. For most of them, they are shown {G}{R}{B}, which is the opposite of today's {B}{R}{G}. But [autocard]Vaevictis Asmadi[/autocard] gets it 'right'.\n4. What is the Color Wheel of Ye Olde Magick?\nLooking up some old deck boxes, it has sometimes started with {U} instead of {W} and sometimes started with {R}. \nIn Legends, the Color Wheel was {U}{B}{R}{G}{W}, which ironically was the pecking order of which cards sucked or not. x) (Obviously every single color had strong cards as early as Alpha, but the colors were still not created equal for deckbuilding. Basically Banding is so much worse than Trample (by a bajillion) that [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] just doesn't make up for it.

It puts serious pressure on the opponent, especially in the early game. One of these dropped on turn one essentially nets you an Ancestral Recall. A few turns later, it forces your opponent into the difficult decision of staying on their current land count (if they happened to be tied with you in number of lands) or going ahead, furthering their development but causing yours to take a huge jump. Long story short, this card is excellent.5/5",

Conversion costs the same amount but will likely cause your opponent to suffocate rather than just delaying the game by allowing you to gain life.

If we applied current Spike evaluation standards to the [i]Legends[/i] Legends, only cards deemed too powerful for reprint would make it like [autocard]Adun Oakenshield[/autocard], which isn't a fair standard as people will just end up raving against the Reserved List (Adun Oakenshield is a card that is kept from reprint by *more than just* the Reserved List- he really is quite Spike). Assuming that Timmy, Johnny, Melvin, and Vorthos actually matter, but we DO want a good deal for our mana, here are the Legends from Legends that I say \"make the cut\": \n{U}/{W}: [autocard]Hunding Gjornersen[/autocard]. Although [b]Rampage[/b] does require the use of Lure, I think most of the Rampagers bear mentioning because it's a hoop worth going through on almost all of them. They actually are pretty big, something that ALL of the [i]Legends[/i] were supposed to feel like, but only some delivered on. [autocard]Rasputin Dreamweaver[/autocard]: apparently, some people are capable of taking really stupid abilities and making really stupid decks to match. XD I won't pretend to defend the rest of this color pair. :) \n{U}/{B}: [autocard]Nebuchadnezzar[/autocard]: He may not look like much of a fighter, but he's in the right colors for being what he is- he doesn't look like a threat, but his disruption ability is by all means useable. [autocard]Ramses Overdark[/autocard]. Like Rampagers, he requires hoops to be gone through, but he DOES kill things on tapping, which I think is still playable today. [autocard]Svitri Scarzum[/autocard] even though it's a vanilla, I did say I'd be comparing creatures' P/T to Jedit Ojanen. She's got 6 Power for 7 mana, which is close to as good a deal as the Elder Dragons get, plus she's splashable- being only 2 colored mana instead 3 colored mana of 2 different colors makes a lot of difference. \n{B}/{R}: [autocard]Lady Orca[/autocard] is best, [autocard]Boris Devilboon[/autocard] would have still been appreciated in Standard only a short while ago, [autocard]Pavel Maliki[/autocard] has manabreathing, [autocard]Rohgahh of Kher Keep[/autocard] gets sympathy for Devotion to Kobolds.\n{R}/{G}: [autocard]Jerrard of the Closed Fist[/autocard] has good P/T, [autocard]Marhault[/autocard] has a LOT to say for himself putting together gameplay -and- fun, [autocard]Stangg[/autocard] is wierd but 6/8 is great, [autocard]Sunastian Falconer[/autocard] has [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard] which should not be underestimated. \nHmmm....I'm naming a lot more than I expected. Already 13 of the 35 2-colored Legends, before getting to {G}/{W}? I think you could eliminate a further 5 or 6 of them, and end up with only approving of 20 of the 55 Legends (it is really hard to argue against any of the 3-color ones, although not even every Elder Dragon quite makes it.) \nStill, around half the Legends are better than they look. Let's say that no amount of color synergy is enough for you, and you Demand they have to have P or T = CMC. You would still have 12 left to choose from (but no Elder Dragons, and everyone knows at least 2 or 3 of the Dragons are playable, the Red ones, so you might want to re-evaluate).  Many more become playable if you accept \"P or T = CMC -1 or greater\" There are 7 of each Color Pair, and 4 of each Color Triplet, and out of those 11 cycles, I would say at least 4 cycles' worth (20 cards, not necessarily complete cycles) are plenty good enough to use in a deck, with *at least* 10 cards (1/11th) actually being strong enough to build decks around.",

So yes, Master of the bearded collie is fairly accurate to the myth (Wolf HOUND, actually). It's the terminology on the card that that is inconsistent with the myth. I pointed that out to WOTC when the card came out, but it was done by then. WOTC would have had chances to get me to change them to wolves, if they had wanted it.

You see, the legends print run was of 35 million cards. That sounds reasonable for the time, considering Arabian Knights had a print run of only 5 millions. But actually, legends is significantly more rare. This is because it had a core-set style print rather than an expert expansion style print. Legends had 310 cards in it, which is actually more than A/B/U/R had. But it was treated as an expansion, not as a core set. This means it had a much shorter print run. There are actually about 3000 MORE black lotuses printed, by my calculations, than moats. When one considers that there is the option to play 4 of these goddamn things in one deck, and it is legacy legal, one realizes that a price tag of $200 is not only understandable; it is actually reasonable.Don't get me started on the Portal sets -_____________-",

Andrion's advantage over [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] and [autocard]Air Elemental[/autocard] was that once you got the Cathedral of Serra and/or Seafarers' Quay out, he'd have banding, every turn (not every other turn like with [autocard]Helm of Chatzuk[/autocard], not to mention the banding would be for more than just one creature). Very selective banding, yes, but it WAS within the adventurers' party (q.v. D&D personal campaign inspirations); the Cathedral & Co. were where the adventurers met and formed that party. In fact, extrapolating from the whole situation with Andrion, I think the original intent was that you were EXPECTED to use these lands to create the adventuring party, and thus bring the legends to their intended potential. Very strictly top-down design, but I think the problem was just overestimating how powerful banding was.",

Magic should also carry fun stuff, and funny drawings (kithking are not funny, but deformed) , now they are scarcer.Thus how can you be so heretical ?, why in hte world we want yet another fierce, firebreathing dragon? please magic must be something more than just common fantasy art.

It's not coloured and only you benefit. It does have a different use, so I guess I can't compare...Oh, wait! I'd probably play this over Heartless Summoning.

Princess Lucrezia offered blue/black players a large creature with no real drawbacks except her casting cost.  And then the Princess offered a little bit more.  She could add blue mana to your mana pool.  This made her an effective blocker, as well as provide extra mana to power counterspells.  For the sake of comparison, take a look at Sivitri Scarzam.

It's also noteworthy that if they reprinted this guy he'd definitely be red. This template is really simple, but it has a similar gameplay effect to the more complicated wording on the trainee, with the added bonus that it enables this to interact with cards that care about creatures taking damage. His power level seems pretty low now, especially compared to modern five and six drop creatures, but even taking that into consideration he was probably always a lot worse than just Psionic Blasting them for 2 less mana. 2/5",

And yet, the life-gain hating kiddies will grudgingly admit that these are all powerful cards.\nYou are certainly at a low life total if you're casting Rebirth. You're probably gaining around 15 life for the cost of 6 mana. If you're playing by the oldschool rules (which you should) then you can pay all your life into a spell that requires it, then cast Rebirth and gain it all back. If using these original rules, Rebirth is an excellent follow-up to the otherwise unplayable (and apallingly overrated) [autocard]Spoils of the Vault[/autocard].\nOh, by the way - Rebirth combos with [autocard]Channel[/autocard], [autocard]Greed[/autocard], [autocard]Sylvan Library[/autocard], [autocard]Necropotence[/autocard], [autocard]Hatred[/autocard], and [autocard]Yawgmoth's Bargain[/autocard].

This falls apart in modern times during multiplayer.\nAnyway, basically only useful as defense against enemy Auras. It's a mere  though, so if your group uses lots of Auras on you, it'll be useful.

It would be terrible if green had a fun enchant world that allowed both players to rampage across the battlefield!\n[autocard]Reincarnation[/autocard] - uh, like, hey, only white or black can bring creatures from graveyard to play. Can't let green do that - it's too much fun.\n[autocard]Revelation[/autocard] - like OMG and stuff, only blue is allowed to let you see opponent's hand. An enchant world that did that across the board would be too interesting.\n[autocard]Storm Seeker[/autocard] - like, dude, only red spells can directly damage your opponent. Green can't do that, it would make green not suck so much.\n[autocard]Sylvan Library[/autocard] - dude! Improving your card draw and seeing what's coming down the road? That's a good ability, and only blue can have fun and intersting abilities. Green's only allowed to have ugly trampling things and pointless 1/1 fungus tokens littering the battlefield.\nThank God the designers of Legends weren't operating out of Marky Mark Rosewater's \"Color Pie\" straightjacket.",

Andrion's advantage over [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] and [autocard]Air Elemental[/autocard] was that once you got the Cathedral of Serra and/or Seafarers' Quay out, he'd have banding, every turn (not every other turn like with [autocard]Helm of Chatzuk[/autocard], not to mention the banding would be for more than just one creature). Very selective banding, yes, but it WAS within the adventurers' party (q.v. D&D personal campaign inspirations); the Cathedral & Co. were where the adventurers met and formed that party. In fact, extrapolating from the whole situation with Andrion, I think the original intent was that you were EXPECTED to use these lands to create the adventuring party, and thus bring the legends to their intended potential. Very strictly top-down design, but I think the problem was just overestimating how powerful banding was.",

If you have one big creature, and I have a bunch of small creatures, I could block with all of my creatures to kill your big creature.  Without banding, that would mean that you'd distribute the damage, and would kill off all of my blockers.  If even one single one of my creatures has banding, though, then I get to distribute your damage, instead, and I can thus dump it all on my least-valuable creature, and make a very lopsided trade.",

That's what this card has going for it.\nIn general, this card isn't all that poorly made given the era in which it existed. It plays like a counterspell even though it is worded like a white card.\n[i]Legends [/i]designers liked making cards that represented one of three categories: 1) Enormous Walls. 2) Fatties big enough to knock down enormous Walls. 3) Things you might imagine a magic-user doing in 1st Edition [b]Dungeons & Dragons[/b]. Silhouette is obviously in the last camp. For all I know there was a 1st Edition spell called [i]silhouette[/i].\nMy main regret with this card is that, like many others in the set it's from, it uses up a simple one-word name that would ultimately be better dedployed elsewhere. And no, we have no plans to reuse old (English) card names.\nIf you feel like you've seen this goofy card on our website more than might be warranted, that's because it is the pet card of one of dailymtg.com's content managers, Monty Ashley. I know Monty has used it as a Card of the Day, a Wallpaper of the Week, and used it as part of the \"Deck Registration Simulator\" this past April Fool's Day. Here's to you, Montykins!",

I agree that a buyback effect would be fantastic, and that a cycle of spells as you described would be interesting. The problem is, it would practically break the game in two, especially if card cost was relatively low... As an example, when used with Wild Defiance, you can beef up creatures pretty efficiently without losing any cards in your hand. I'm sure there's other combinations too that would work. Lastly even though the storm mechanic is already busted beyond belief, you could really rack up your spell count by recycling cards as you suggested.",

      "content": "I love looking back at the sets from [i]Arabian Nights[/i] -to- [i]Fallen Empires[/i] to look for new inspiration to give old cards a second day in the sun. I don't even own all of them yet, and as a collector I know I eventually *will*, but as a player I also want to know which cards I should be promoting to be given their fair due. :) \nI did some math, and out of 55 Legends in [i]Legends[/i], a meager 12 of them have P/T *equal* to their casting cost (and none greater....I think?). The [b]Elder Dragon Legends[/b] cannot boast as much among any of them! But, then, they have the truly good FLYING ability. Flying and TRAMPLE can each be considered worth a full {1} in, even many sets today, but particularly [i]Legends[/i]. If you were to say that a card *has* to have 'either Flying/orTrample, or CMC = P', then you would consider less than 1/8-1/7 of the [i]Legends[/i] Legends to be even playable, let alone good enough to build decks around. \nPalino: either Unlimited or 4th Edition was the Core Set. Players had at least [autocard]Grizzly Bears[/autocard], [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard]s, Blue didn't want creatures, [autocard]Lord of the Pit[/autocard], and ...alright, the Goblin deck really wasn't off the ground yet. [autocard]Ali from Cairo[/autocard]? Was that their best? :( Still..there was enough to know that P/T should close to match CMC. Although T was probably valued exactly as much as P, unlike today.\nThis card fails this test. He is in the Large group of [i]Legends[/i] Legends whose Power or Toughness is exactly 1 less than their CMC. They essentially charged exactly {1} for being gold. But, not only does this card have a Borderline POWER NINE effect, it is a mana-ability moreover so you might consider it to be compensation. (I do not suggest applying this logic to the {U}/{B} legends that tap for {U} and {B}, but after all, [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard] is better than Basic [autocard]Island[/autocard] and Basic [autocard]Swamp[/autocard].) \nTherefore I suggest that between this card and vanilla Legend creatures like [autocard]Jedit Ojanen[/autocard] and [autocard]Svitri Scarzum[/autocard], you should pass dread judgment on LEGENDS the set with [autocard]careful consideration[/autocard]: Is being Legedary, being Multicolored, having honestly epic names, flavor texts, and artwork, and being more noticeable in an entire format built for you, worth an actual full {1} mana to you? If so, then add roughly 1.35 stars to your Spike-based evaluations. If not, then you will be left with a scant handful of cards, with a few exceptions to your rule, totalling probably less than 15 out of 55 Legends being cards you'd willingly run. In particular you will have to be impressed by the abilities (on such as [autocard]Nebuchadnezzar[/autocard] or [autocard]Nicol Bolas[/autocard]) which disqualifies all of the Vanilla Legends I believe.\nEither 2/5 or 4/5. Need a copy and a group to playtest him. =P\nUnfortunately, I must also add that this one of the few cards in [i]Legends[/i] where the P/T is close to desirable *and* the ability is desirable....but it's a TAP ability...which means...spending about a card to let you both attack/orblock and still get that mana, other wise he's a 5-cost mana rock that....I apologize: Dies to [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard]. Dying to Doom Blade is not a good test for most Legends Legends, but most of the other ones really are trying to be fighters, and this one threatens to be a Mana Rock only. If he only had Vigilance! \nFrankly, my best Advice for any [i]Legends[/i] EDH deck is: [autocard]Akroma's Memorial[/autocard] is more first-pickable than Sol Ring. I shit you not. :P It gives your Commander everything it's lacking and completely changes the conversation-- mostly, FlyingorTrample and Vigilance are the two best words on the artifact, because while the others make good creatures better, these can make 'bad' creatures suddenly good.",

(Necropotence, Jester's Cap, Force of Will, Merchant Scroll). Aggro decks want to buy The Dark for the Red Cards, and they want to trade for a playset of [autocard]Chain Lightning[/autocard] STAT.

When, this card was brutal.This card still holds weight if used in combination with one of the cards mentioned by others who commented before me, but by himself he's pretty useless.  Nine times out of ten your opponent is just going to take the two damage and avoid any thievery of their blockers.",

So Celestial Mantle, while it might not fit in your deck, still is nowhere near 'card ripping party' status.\nAnyway, just a really off-beat question: the 55 Legends from Legends are all part of a huge, ginormous, Mega Ultra Cycle based on the 5 Elder Dragons. 11 cards for each 'Shard'.\n1st Tier its the Elder Dragons (5/55) Example: [autocard]Arcades Sabboth[/autocard], White-centered.\n2nd Tier they each have 3 shard colored lieutenants (20/55) Example: [autocard]Angus Mackenzie[/autocard] (Tim the Enchanter), possibly the highest rated creature from Legends.\n2.5 Tier is 5 allied colored pairs, but unbalanced in favor of the center color of the dragon it matches Example: [autocard]Jedit Ojanen[/autocard] (25/55)\n2.75 Tier is 5 allied colored pairs, double cost each, (30/55) Example: [autocard]Ayesha Tanaka[/autocard]\nand 3rd Tier is the allied colored pairs, single cost each \nbut it's hard with the balanced allied pairs who matches who.\nthere used to be a chart, but now the link is broken (found it on the mothership site, under one of their articles that referenced Legends set)\nSo I was wondering, is there anyone left who would know if this is an Arcades Sabboth WU Legend, or a Chromium WU Legend? And by extension, could help me recreate the old uber-chart of all the Legends?  Or is this the wierdest question anyone's ever asked on Gatherer, about Arcana so old and obscure and, well, Arcane that frikkin nobody knows (or cares) anymore?\nEDIT: wait...I think the balanced allied colored pairs are shared between two Elder Dragons each. So, Ayesha Tanaka and the other WU Legends connect the Arcades tribe to the Chromium one. But Jedit is Arcades-only, and [autocard]Hunding Gjornersen[/autocard] is Chromium-only. That's the only way to make it all 'fit'.",

No, legit she will kill almost any Legendary creature or Flying creature just given Giant Growth or Firebreathing. You want to build a G/W/R deck out of just old cards? \nJust think of Serra Angel as [autocard]Uril, the Miststalker[/autocard] v.0.StoneAge and you'll do fine. o.O\nVerdict: Buy [autocard]Savannah[/autocard] and [autocard]Taiga[/autocard]. o.o",

Andrion's advantage over [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] and [autocard]Air Elemental[/autocard] was that once you got the Cathedral of Serra and/or Seafarers' Quay out, he'd have banding, every turn (not every other turn like with [autocard]Helm of Chatzuk[/autocard], not to mention the banding would be for more than just one creature). Very selective banding, yes, but it WAS within the adventurers' party (q.v. D&D personal campaign inspirations); the Cathedral & Co. were where the adventurers met and formed that party. In fact, extrapolating from the whole situation with Andrion, I think the original intent was that you were EXPECTED to use these lands to create the adventuring party, and thus bring the legends to their intended potential. Very strictly top-down design, but I think the problem was just overestimating how powerful banding was.",

For best results, DON'T use with Cabal Coffers, because you don't want to go overboard and find that next time everyone is packing Numot, the Devastator.  \nJudging by the comments, this particular land on it's own would not warrant such a response, but I can easily see it's inclusion in a deck next to stuff that WOULD.  \nWord of advice for land lubbers: if you have a small playgroup, and a healthy income, it may well be worth your trouble to buy your friends a round of From the Vault: Exiled Strip Mines to slide in their decks, on the condition they use them only in their decks that do not contain Numot.

On the other hand, if you put out Doran you get a black Lhurgoyf with defender.This has a few things working against it, mostly its toughness being updated during your upkeep, which makes its useless on its first turn.  I'd also be a lot more impressed if its toughness was based on the number of creature cards in ALL graveyards, not just yours.  If Mortivore can function like that with a regeneration ability for four mana, I don't see why a zero-power defender couldn't work the same way for half the cost.",

Was in a hurry when i first posted.\nThis was just using what I had. Any static green buff can replace [autocard]Kaysa[/autocard], as long as it doesn't buff you opponents creatures ([autocard]Gaea's Anthem[/autocard] is cheaper). You can also used your preferred mana ramp. I like the [autocard]Gemhide Slivers [/autocard]because then all my changelings produce mana of any color. Nice in a dual color deck). Now, here's the POS combo Albino, don't sacrifice a forest to the beast. Now you can use your changelings to turn their creatures into a 0/0. Meanwhile, use [autocard]march of the machines[/autocard] and your [autocard]myr landshaper[/autocard]s to eliminate their land. \nIf all else fails, tap the four, sacrifice your [autocard]Llanowar Druid[/autocard] (can be replaced by early harvest) to untap your forests and then sacrifice them all. This combo kinda works in a red/green beat down with [autocard]Akki Raider[/autocard]. You get a 4/4 and a 4/1 until end of turn. Of course, it would be nice to have a [autocard]crucible of worlds[/autocard], but there are other ways to get lands out of your graveyard. Then, there's always [autocard]terravore[/autocard].\nNone of these may be the best combo's in magic (they all require at least three cards and too much mana), but if you're playing a wood elemental, you're obviously not playing at tournament level. \nYour comment Albino more makes me long for the olden days of magic before \"meta decks\" when players used a little thing like creativity to create decks to play for FUN.  Having returned to magic from a long absence, I'm a disappointed  to see the creativity has been stripped away - now top decks all feature [autocard]Jace, the Mind Sculptor[/autocard], [autocard]Day of Judgment[/autocard], [autocard]Elspeth, Knight-Errant[/autocard], etc...",
