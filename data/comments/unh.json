I think it would be more fun if a wish could get it, but then the point of the card - to absolutely remove the card from the game - is defeated if wishes could get them back.

Now i see the [autocard]Cabal Trainee[/autocard]'s artwork again it's so obvious. He seemed to wear a red-blue striped cloak and overall more comic-like so i supposed he'd be an unglued-only character. So this sign might even refer to the faceshredder he's about to get killed by on the original card. Or simply the [autocard]Flametongue Kavu[/autocard] that looks down to him.\nGreat work on the list. I think i can complete your list now.\n(Didn't even notice the [autocard]Storm Spirit[/autocard] on the top left, and I had problems making out what goblin used that ballon again, i knew it was an old one but i forgot about the [autocard multiverseid=\"20195\"]Portal artwork[/autocard] from [autocard]Goblin Glider[/autocard].)\nThe other dragon left from [autocard]Firestorm Hellkite[/autocard] is [autocard]Crosis, the Purger[/autocard]. I think i can see a [autocard]Saprazzan Breaker[/autocard] between both.\nThe Goblin on the bottom left is likely [autocard]Skirk Marauder[/autocard]. (Possibly also the one in the middle of [autocard]Mons's Goblin Raiders[/autocard], but i don't think so.)\nThe handsome man next to Shauku is [autocard]Baron Sengir[/autocard]. \nThe one in the middle above them and below [autocard]Megatog[/autocard] is [autocard]Cabal Archon[/autocard].\nMaybe, just maybe the [autocard]Baron Sengir[/autocard] x [autocard multiverseid=\"3311\"]Shauku[/autocard] ship is a very subliminal reference to Princess Clara and the Delivery Guy (aka Satan) from the Episode [i]Lost in Parking Space[/i]? :D",

The battle of wits between the two players of which question to ask and how to slide around their answers is very flavorful.I find the best uses involve getting hidden information (\"Do you have any spells that can counter my spells in your hand?\") or forcing actions (\"Will you block my creatures?\" or \"Will you counter my next spell?\") that affect the game state.",

See Wikipedia for more info).Similarly for people who are combining this with Paradox Haze to ask 2 questions, then saying stuff like \"Will you answer the next question 'Yes'?\", the answer \"I don't know\" is perfectly valid in the same way it would be if you had asked \"Will the next card you draw be a land?\".",

And R&D’s initials actually stand for something: Randy & Del.\nRandy Buelher, former Director of [b]Magic [/b]R&D, and his wife, Del Laugel, current Senior [b]Magic [/b]Editor, are the first family of making [b]Magic[/b], so it makes sense that the department is named after them. The blue handwriting on this particular card is, in fact, Randy’s. (The red editorial markings on [autocard]Frazzled Editor[/autocard], also in [i]Unhinged[/i], are Del’s work.)\nRandy contributed quite a bit to this particular card beyond the hours of playtesting that convinced him to make those hand-written changes. The [autocard]Moat[/autocard] that was ruined when the sticker was applied came from his personal collection, and while he didn’t get to illustrate the card the way Mark Rosewater (under constant surveillance for allegedly being a member of the DCI at one point) did for [autocard]Look at Me, I'm the DCI[/autocard], he did get to hand-select the artist chosen to do the painting. As you can see from the scribblings at the bottom, he nominated famous the famous Scandinavian surrealist known only as “Sporkj” (that is not a semicolon, I swear, and it certainly isn’t part of some sort of set-wide secret message buried in the legal text), as Sporkj is the only talent on the planet capable of capturing Randy’s full countenance suitably.\nUnfortunately, he missed his deadline and we had to use the sticker.\nHere’s to more random [i]Un[/i]-set cards!",

Can I change this card to be Jojo, the Dog-faced Lizard Boy?\nNo.\nCan I change it to be Solar-Powered Ninja Penguin?\nNo.\nCan I change it to be Siamese Pygmy Pole-Vaulter?\nNo. To save us some space, maybe I should let you know what it can become.[b] You may change this card to have the name of any _Magic_ card in existence.[/b][/i]\nSo, you can only to change it to an actual printed card's name. As far as I know, there is no card printed with the name \"The Comprehensive Rulebook\". Lets check:\n[autocard]The Comprehensive Rulebook[/autocard]. Nope. [autocard]Comprehensive Rulebook[/autocard]. Nothing. [autocard]Comprehensive Rules[/autocard]. Zip. [autocard]Rulebook[/autocard]. Eh-eh. [autocard]Rules[/autocard]. Oh boy. Looks like you can't even name the card \"rules\". So, your combo is looking pretty illegal right now.\nNext, lets look at [autocard]Look at Me, I'm the DCI[/autocard]. If we take a close reading of the oracle text (which is the same as the card's text since un-sets do not receive oracle updates):\n \"[i]Ban one [b]card[/b], other than a basic land, for the remainder of the match. (For the remainder of the match, each player removes from the game all copies of that card in play or in any graveyard, hand, library, or sideboard.)[/i]\nWe have to name a *card* and remove all copies of that [b]card[/b] with that name from in play (on the battlefield), in a graveyard, in a hand (of cards) in a library and in a sideboard. Well, The (actual) Comprehensive Rulebook isn't a card, nor is it found \"in play\" (on the battlefield), in a hand (of cards) or in a library, graveyard or sideboard.\nSo, we can't name ____ \"The Comprehensive Rulebook\" since there is no printed card in the history of all [i][b]Magic[/b]: The Gathering[/i] with that name. Even if we could, we could only remove [b][i]cards named \"The Comprehensive Rulebook\"[/i][/b] from [b]in play (on the battlefield), in hands (of cards) in libraries, graveyards and sideboards[/b]. Look at Me, I'm the DCI says nothing about removing things with that name from anywhere else, and since The (actual) Comprehensive Rulebook [b]IS NOT[/b] located in those zones, we cannot remove it from the game.\nSince we cannot remove The (actual) Comprehensive Rulebook, or any rules within it, from the game, you [b]CANNOT[/b] change _____'s name to \"the entire text of all seven Harry Potter books\". I would also have to point out that you would technically have to say all 1,084,170 words to officially name ____ all the words in the text of all seven Harry Potter books, which would take an excessively long time to say and would violate tournament rules stating that players are expected to play at a reasonable pace. I'm sure a judge would cut you off after 50 or so words anyway. \nSo, Darthparallax, [b]YOUR COMBO IS ILLEGAL![/b]\nAnd of course, _____ enchanted with Wordmail dies to [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard]. THERE! I SAID IT!\nThere. I have saved The Comprehensive Rulebook from total anarchy. I am the ultimate rules lawyer. MWUHAHAHAHAAAAA!!! Bow to my ultimate rules knowledge!

To resolve this, you have to remember that Gleemax controls R&D, R&D trumps Richard Garfield and Richard Garfield has power over Gleemax (and all other cards).\nThe end result of this is that Surgical Extraction becomes subjected to so many replacement effects, it melts and then somehow or other gains the ability to Surgically Extract Chains of Mephistopheles' Oracle Text from the nature of the card. Then you throw the Oracle Text (JUST the Oracle Text, not the rest of the card) into a Knowledge Pool. \nThen everyone else ragequits because their brains are completely fried.",

Does this ability resolve?\"\nnow, there are four ways that this can play out from here.\nWay 1:\nP2: \"In response to Ambiguity's triggered ability, I play another Disenchant.\"\norder of resolution: 2nd Disenchant, then Ambiguity's triggered ability, then Counterspell (removing first Disenchant from the stack)\nWay 2/3/4:\nP2: \"Yes, I will let it resolve.\"\nWay 2: P1:\"I choose to counter the next spell played this turn.\" OR\nWay 3: P1:\"I choose to place a counter on a permanent that is already in play and already has at least one counter on it. The counter is of a type that the permanent already has one or more counters of that type on it.(if a permanent has -1/-1 counters and +1/+1 counters, for example, you may choose to put one counter of either type on the permanent)\" OR\nWay 4: P1: \"I choose not to use this ability, on the basis of the word 'may' in the card text.\"\nThe one issue that I'm unsure of, is how to interpret \"that has already been played, but not countered\" part of determining a valid permanent to put an additional counter on. I'd imagine that this means that if I were to discard a [autocard]Spike Drone[/autocard] then play [autocard]Reanimate[/autocard] to bring that Spike Drone into play, it would not be a valid recipient of a counter from Ambiguity. However, if I had played the Spike Drone, then used its ability (thus killing it as a state based effect), then Reanimated it, it would be a valid recipient. If I had attempted to play Spike Drone, had it counterspelled, then used Reanimate to put it in play, it would also not be a valid recipient.\nAlso, note that Ambiguity only triggers (for the counterspell trigger) when someone plays a counter spell targetting a spell that was PLAYED, not copied. Playing a counter on a Storm copy, [autocard]Fork[/autocard] copy, Conspire copy, etc, would not trigger it.\nNone of the \"simplified/deciphered\" versions of the text in this thread come close to actually fully encompassing the card as worded in the Oracle text. 'Ambiguity' doesn't really describe this card so much as 'overly complicated'.",

(I assume this card follows proliferate rules, but this is Unhinged, so perhaps not.)2) A player casts a spell that, when it resolves, enters the battlefield with counters on it — for example, a planeswalker or an Arcbound creature.a) That player may counter the next spell that is cast.b) That player may put a counter on a permanent, limited to a type of counter already on that permanent.Hope this helps anyone who was confused about this card's functionality.

There is even a card in Unhinged ([autocard]Water Gun Balloon Game[/autocard]) that puts pink tokens into play.\nNow, the cost: it costs 1 [b]more[/b] to play for each [b]ten years[/b] you have been alive. It has a base cost of 2UU that also needs to be counted to the total. So, if you are younger than 10 years, your avatar will cost you just 2UU. If you are older than 10, but younger than 20 years, it costs 3UU. 20-30 years would cost 4UU, 30-40 years costs 5UU, and so on. So, if you are 70 or older, it will reach the 11 mana total (not at 110 years as someone pointed out). It is not clear, however, if we should count the remaining years as fractions of mana: there are cases where half-manas are used, but having to count the exact fraction would be insane: do we count fractions of years (days) proportionally as well? So, whatever it costs your avatar today, it will cost 1/3650 more mana tomorrow. That'd be insanelly unplayable, at least until the next rules update gets rid of mana burn.\nBack to ttian's comment: are you one feet tall, wear size 2 shoes and are between 70 and 80 years old? If so, then it definitelly is a 1/1  for 11. On my case, it would be a 6/4 for 4UU, so basically I got a blue  [autocard]Craw Wurm[/autocard] (yes, I have blue eyes, so the color of the avatar would actually match the color of mana on its cost! ^^ )",

Use [autocard]Conspiracy[/autocard] to make use of [autocard]Rooftop Storm[/autocard], allowing you to cast [autocard]Primordial Sage[/autocard] for [0] and subsequently the rest of the creatures in your deck, but only after you've played [autocard]Mana Severence[/autocard] to make sure you don't hit any lands, of course. [autocard]Knowledge Pool[/autocard] will f*** up your opponents' attempts to stop the combo, if nothing else. \nBut [autocard]Knowledge Pool[/autocard] alone is enough to make all hell break loose.\nAs for breaking it without using [autocard]Knowledge Pool[/autocard] or [autocard]Rooftop Storm[/autocard], the easy example would be using it to help dredge up four [autocard]Vengevine[/autocard]s while using [autocard]Nether Void[/autocard] for protection.

[autocard]Form of the Squirrel[/autocard] seems like the type of silly card that is very evocative and interesting, and has some build-around-me potential, but which is ultimately bad. They make cards like this in black borders as well, though not quite to the same degree.\n[autocard]Now I Know My ABC's[/autocard] is obviously silly and build-around-me, but, on the surface, to me at least, seems a little more easy to 'assemble'. And when you do 'assemble' it, you win the game. I'd have to actually do a search for tons of permanents to find the right build for a deck built around this card, but it seems like doing that search and finding the right cards is the actual game this card is presenting to players. Anyway, I'd have to see an optimized deck list to know for sure, and I could be totally wrong, but three mana seems much too cheap for an upkeep-win trigger.\nI think the worst part about it is that despite being obviously silly, it doesn't create interesting or silly game play. Unless you consider scouring permanents' names for particular letters to be interesting.",

And I'm pretty tired of Jace, the Mind Sculptor getting such a horrid wrap among players. It kinda make you sound like the Indie Hipster to talking down to a guy because his music is \"too mainstream\". He's a great utility card, and crucial to many decks strategies being optimized and executed. No, I don't think this warrants a 75-90 dollar price tag, but thats supply versus demand. As for the Card in question, -now that the rant has been exhausted out of me- it is simply amazing. Mental Magic was always a fun thing at school. And the EDH possibilites makes my Johnny-bells jingle. 10/5",

The art hack feels cool, but using Moxen in the first place isn't necessarily encouraged)\nAnd of course, Christopher Rush did, just to name ONE card that makes it worth knowing his name, BLACK. LOTUS.  And he's painted other cards that are generally cool beyond just that.\nI think Jason Chan has done more Planeswalkers than anyone else though, except whoever painted the Lorwyn 5.\nDISCLAIMER: I'm sure a Therese Neilson (spelling?) deck would be AMAZINGLY beautiful....I am less sure that it could be competitive against a Jason Chan deck. I'm sure you could even make a 'pretty good' deck with her.....but Jace is Jace. The other guys I listed would give you access to cards that would stomp Nielson pretty soundly.",

What about if I make nice neat little chunks and drop them skin side down on the card, is it 2 damage for each?If this is sleeved, will any damage be taken at all? If not, can either player remove it from the sleeve (if so just paint over the clear side and when your opponent pulls it out to look at it they take at least 2 damage)These questions need answering, can any judges help?",

Come on.\nOkay, so to make the most use out of your Fanboy, you'll want him triggering off of copies of himself. So the obvious choice of artist here is Matt Cavotta. \"Is this going to be a Matt Cavotta theme deck?\" I hear you ask. Why yes. Yes it is.\nSo to capitalize on our Cavotta investment, we'll want [autocard]Drawn Together[/autocard] for a nice team boost. And since we're making creatures huge anyway, why not give them trample? [autocard]Graphic Violence[/autocard] is our budget overrun. \"But Doctor!\" you now whine \"We're now in three colours! And not even nice, Shard colours!\" Fear not, Gatherites. I've got you covered. Rather, Matt does.\nCavotta was kind enough to illustrate a version of [autocard]Yavimaya Elder[/autocard], which will not only help us accelerate, but also trigger the fanboy. And with all this creature pump going around, a big fatty like [autocard]Copperhoof Vorrac[/autocard] isn't unwelcome. Speaking of fat, Matt also gives us the combo-liscious [autocard]Protean Hulk[/autocard] - though we don't really have much of a toolbox to fetch with him in this deck. Oh, and lets not forget [autocard]Great Sable Stag[/autocard] for hosing down control. [autocard]Tattermunge Maniac[/autocard] dropped early won't have much of a drawback by the time Drawn Together comes around, and even then, your Maniac is expendable with a Fanboy around.\nA few fliers, of course, would be nice. When you're running a casual deck, you never know what you might face- good air support is always wanted. [autocard]Skyhunter Patrol[/autocard] is good for the mid-range. Sadly, our flier range is limited here, but maybe you'll be smashing enough face so that won't matter.\nLuckily, however, being in black gives us access to a host of removal. Go nuts. You don't need me to tell you what removal is awesome. Though don't forget that you have access to black AND white, and there is nothing sexier than the words \"Destroy target permanent\". You could even add a \"and every permenent with the same name\" for gravy. Note also that [autocard]Erase (Not the Urza's Legacy One)[/autocard] and [autocard]Remodel[/autocard] are good sideboard material.\nHave fun, and be sure to thank Mr. Cavotta.",

But having buyback is awesome for repeated castings, and even if you don't pay the buyback cost, you can still cast it with flashback later.For those who don't understand about flashback+buyback together: You can't flashback a card and then use buyback to put it back to your hand.  Flashback's replacement effect will exile it regardless of whether or not you used the buyback option... but you can still pay the buyback cost, of course - it just won't do anything unless you are still playing with mana burn.",

If you pay without buyback it goes to your graveyard on resolution like any other instant, but with flashback you can play it one more time before it goes to the exile zone. Either way you can get a minimum of two shots with it.I love the Tempest block for many reasons and buyback was excellent on certain cards. I've probably cast Capsize more times than anything else, now that I think about it. I once staved off defeat with Captize for dozens of turns until the other guy drew himself to death.",

We can only assume that its flipping the card somehow, or else the creature part would be useless. So when you enchantment a creature, you consume it and it ceases to exist. When Curse of the Fire Penguin leaves play, the enchanted creature gos into its owners graveyard. The confuse part just means to flip fire penguin. So, you enchant a creature, that creature gos away and you flip Fire Penguin getting a 6/5 trample. When fire penguin dies, put the enchanted creature in its owners graveyard and return Fire Penguin to its owners hand.At least this is how I would do it. They want you to come up with your own method :D",

While it may seem these effects happen instantly and cannot be stopped, they have their own timing regulations. In this case (and with many other [X]-based creatures like many [autocard name=\"hydra\"]hydras[/autocard]) these come into play. \nFor one thing, [b]SBE[/b] are only checked when the next player receives priority (can cast a spell or activate an ability). A player cannot respond (do something) to anything while a spell/ability is in the process of resolving. This ability, for example, doesn't finish resolving until the counters are placed (or he is sacrificed) and it triggers AS it comes into play. So there is never a time where this is a 0/0 creature AND on the battlefield when a player receives priority (unless you pick zero counters), so by the time [b]SBE[/b]s are checked, it has it's counters.",

So I'd assume that a Ball Lightning would be sacrificed at the end of the turn you reveal it. \nThe FAQ also says that creature enchantments are revealed, considered to be in play, and sacrificed because they aren't enchanting anything before you have a chance to do anything with them. Likewise, I think the same would be true of planeswalkers. They are sacrificed as a state-based effect when they run out of loyalty counters, right? Loyalty counters are put on them when they enter the battlefield, but remember, cards on top of your library don't trigger \"enters the battlefield\" effects with this. So a planeswalker or creature enchantment would be revealed and immediately sacrificed. That's pretty powerful.",

Note the \"As this comes into play\" wording as opposed to \"When this comes into play\".\nThis replacement effect creates a delayed triggered ability that will go off when the token leaves play, much like the abilities of [autocard]Phantasmal Mount[/autocard] or [autocard]Dance of the Dead[/autocard].\nThe question is, if you [autocard]Donate[/autocard] the enchantment away before it triggers, who will lose the game?\nThe answer can be found in 603.7f (emphasis added):\n603.7f If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to\nbe created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. [b]The\ncontroller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time\nthe replacement effect was applied.[/b]\nIf the enchantment entered the battlefield under your control, you will lose the game when the squirrel token leaves play no matter who controls the enchantment at that time.\nA previous post mentioned Phasing. This [i]is[/i] a combo. Phasing out does not trigger leaves-play abilities (702.24d), and a phased-out token ceases to exist as a state-based action (702.24k). So if you manage to phase out the token (for example, with [autocard]Teferi's Veil[/autocard]), you will not lose the game when it leaves, and the token will never come back. You cannot, however, phase out the enchantment to prevent it from triggering (a delayed triggered ability can still trigger even if the original source is no longer around).",

So... does that mean that when the enchantment leaves play, the token becomes just a plain ol' 1/1 squirrel token with no abilities? Since all of the errata is on the card, and not the token. For that matter, what would happen if an opponent [autocard]flicker[/autocard]ed this enchantment, thus producing TWO squirrel tokens under your control? The card says that you cannot be chosen for a spell or ability by the opponent, but it says nothing about the card itself having that same protection. And what would happen if one of your tokens die, but the other is still on the field?\nOn a side-note, this card seems to have been made for stylish wins. Which is already pure awesome. Some ideas I had were playing [autocard]Jhoira of the Ghitu[/autocard], then using her ability to suspend [autocard]Worldfire[/autocard], then suspend this card. When the suspend counters are used up, everyone loses all permanents, hands, and their life is 1, while you have an enchantment coming in immediately after giving you a 1/1 creature to attack with =). Another idea might be attacking with [autocard]Master of Cruelties[/autocard], and then swinging in with your squirrel token next turn for game.\nTo truly appreciate this card, zany combos need to be played with it. And when those combos do succeed, even if only just once, it will provide amusement for many, many days to come when telling the story of that match =)",

A creature may be a part of only one band. A single band can only attack a single player or planeswalker. A band remains for the entirety of combat even if \"bands with other Dinosaurs\" is removed from any or all creatures with it. An attacking creature that is removed from combat is also removed from its band. Banding does not cause creatures in the band to share or remove abilities. If one creature in the band is blocked, all creatures in the band become blocked. The controller of the band determines how combat damage is split between creatures in the band, instead of the other player.\nProtection from Homarids: ~ cannot be damaged, enchanted, equipped, fortified, blocked, or targeted by Homarids.\nSnow-covered Plainswalk: ~ is unblockable as long as the defending player controls a land that is both a Plains and snow.\nFlanking: If ~ is blocked by a creature without flanking, that creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.\nRampage 2: If ~ is blocked by more than one creature, it gets +2/+2 until end of turn for each blocking creature beyond the first.\nHope that clears things up!",

The name, by the way, was inspired by the movie C.H.U.D.'.\nIMDb says that stands for 'Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller', but can also mean 'Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal' as apparently some crates are labeled  in the movie.

Or can you for instance, wave it in your opponent's face until they read it and then tell them they're stoned.Or in a more possible situation, if an opponent uses an ability to look at your hand and they end up seeing it there, would it trigger?Or if it's in your graveyard and they use a reanimation spell and read it while looking for targets, can a dead basilisk still get you stoned?I'm thinking it can, I mean it is an Un card after all.",

Alternatively, I give the bear Supersize, making it a 5.5/5.5, still coming out on top.I'm not saying anything about the quality or power level of the card, objectively. I'm just saying that in a lot of cases, there's essentially no difference between this and M12's Titanic Growth. A 2/2 will kill a 5/5 whether it (the 2/2) has been pumped to 6/6 or 5.5/5.5.The difference is only significant if you're staring down a 6/6 with your 2/2, in which case Supersize isn't going to be powerful enough to let the creatures trade in combat.So yeah, Titanic Growth is pretty much strictly better, but whatever.

Secondly, the way its worded means its a triggered ability, meaning it hits once when it says. It also couldn't be interpreted as letting you get multiple creatures because it says \"put it into play\" not \"them.\" Its not that technical dude you just have to read it carefully. The rules aren't that complicated and the vast majority of cards, especially the modern ones, are clearly worded. AND gatherer is a great resource for clarifying rulings.

It also has a CMC greater than 2, but the Scepter only asks if it has a CMC below 2, and it has.\nOn the other hand, if you're revealing it for Dark Confidant, you will lose 1 life and 2 life and 3 life and 3 life and 4 life, for a total of 13 life.\nAnd finally, Spell Snare can only counter it if you're casting as a \"Why\" or a \"Who\" if X=1, nothing else.\nYes, split cards are a bit exotic, even outside of un-cards.",

I'd seen this card before and thought it was a funny 'split card' progression, but I'd never actually considered playing with it. Each piece is an overcosted version of some simple effect, though not significantly overcosted. And each of those effects could potentially be pretty useful within a game of Commander. I don't know the general expected etiquette of Commander games when it comes to Un- cards, though. Of course, they're not black-bordered so they're not 'allowed' technically, and I've never seen someone playing with one, but I think if you just starting casting one, people would just laugh and continue enjoying the game. Even the 'target player' on the Who portion makes this potentially a political card as much as it is versatile.\nOn another note, split cards are supposed to be read as \"X and Y\". In the case of a five-card split, I guess the correct reading is \"Who What When Where and Why.\" Also, for anyone interested in such things, while normally a cards' mana symbols and color references are according to the color-wheel-order (white, blue, black, red, green; with rules about what to do with enemy colors and green-white, etc.), split cards's color order were, of course, determined by the phrase that named them. For instance, in a blue-red pairing, blue comes first, but on [autocard]Fire/Ice[/autocard], red came first because of the term 'fire and ice'. And in the case of this card, we see a mish-mash of colors in different shapes and sizes just to make the concept work.",

Plus you can stop any problematic creature as long as its still on the stack. Basically, the only thing it won't get rid of in planeswalkers.You almost have a card that says \"Destroy target permanent.\" An advanced search for cards with the text \"destroy target permanent\" returned 16 results.Out of all 16 of those cards, 15 of them are A) A heck of a lot more expensive and/or B) Have some sort of targeting restriction.

One favorite combo of mine is [autocard]Basalt Monolith[/autocard] + [autocard]Rings of Brighthearth[/autocard]. Once both of those artifacts are on the field, you will need 5 mana available to get things going. First, pay the cost to untap Basalt Monolith, then tap it for 3 mana. Activate the Rings of Brighthearth to copy that activated ability, producing another 3 mana. At this point, you can use the three mana generated from the rings to untap Basalt Monolith again, then tap it again for another 3 mana, and then pay the ring's activation cost to copy the ability again, producing 3 more mana. In this way, you will always have 1 extra mana generated that increases with each loop.\nIf an opponent is mean, they might make you go through this repetition manually to generate the one million mana needed to cast this, so be careful, lol.",

You can afford to lose sometimes, as long as you earn back the lost mana and never get down to [0].\nThis card is very powerful, or would be if it were played in a real set. With the Thumb, it becomes one of the cheapest infinite-mana combos around. And I do mean infinite.\nThis minigame is covered by the Gambler's Ruin Theorem, which gives a very simple formula for the probability that you will eventually reach X mana given that you currently have Y. The formula is X divided by Y. This means that, starting from [1], you have a 1/1,000,000 chance of being able to cast Gleemax. And a very tolerable 2/15 chance of getting Emrakul out on the second turn, though with rather a lot of flips.\nThat's the formula for a fair coin. The Thumb essentially replaces that with an unfair coin (one which wins 75% of the time), which complicates the maths somewhat. But you stand to win far more than you lose. In fact, starting at [1] and flipping until you run out, you have a 2 in 3 chance of playing forever, actually getting [i]infinite[/i] mana from this. So yes, that's a 2 in 3 chance of casting Gleemax on turn three, once you get the right cards. You're welcome.",

How long will you take?\nThe result was: most of the time the sequence ends shortly (there's one half of a chance it ends after the very first step), but occasionally (think a one-in-30-or-so chance) your mana pool skyrockets to hundreds before it finally comes back down to zero.\nIf I recall correctly, it was mathematically proven that the average number of steps this experiement will take is infinity (think arbitrarily large), although every single run ends in finitely many steps. For those interested, google search \"random walk\".",

If that card is tapped and it gets destroyed, you better have some backup plan or you'll be losing infinity life due to mana burn.... Of course, I like to make a distinction between \"infinite\" (infinity - infinity = 0) and \"virtually infinite\" (infinity - virtually infinity = infinity) so that I can spend all that mana on something just in case. Sometimes your friends will let you play like that, but I'm not sure how the official rules would look on that.\nOne card combo especially worth mentioning: Put an [autocard]Essence Sliver[/autocard], a [autocard]Sliver Queen[/autocard], and a Magma Sliver out on the field, and tap Mox Lotus. Use the mana to get a bunch of 1/1 colorless Sliver creature tokens, tap some of those to empower the others, and then attack. Any attack that doesn't get neutralized somehow will deal damage to [i]something[/i], and the [autocard]Essence Sliver[/autocard]'s special ability will kick in, giving you a crap-load of life.\n(Sorry for the lack of a link to look up the Magma Sliver.

I understand that the joke is that if you can afford to cast it you should have already won the game by now anyway, but they could have been a bit creative with that idea with additional costs.\nPerhaps they could have tried something like the following (just an example):\nAs an additional cost to play Mox Lotus, choose one - Pay 49 life; or remove 200 cards from your library; or remove twenty creature cards from your graveyard; or sacrifice twenty creatures.\nSomething cute like that to reference iconic alternate win-condition cards where if you were playing one of those cards you would have won already anyway.  If you didn't catch the cards referenced, they were in order: [autocard]Test of Endurance[/autocard], [autocard]Battle of Wits[/autocard], [autocard]Mortal Combat[/autocard], and [autocard]Epic Struggle[/autocard].\nAnother possible option is to push the \"you should have won already\" theme:\nYou can only play Mox Lotus if your opponent has exactly 1 life, or if you have played ten or more spells this turn. or if you have drawn 8 or more cards this turn, or the total power of creatures you control is twenty or higher.",

Unless he did coupon + cheatyface combo.Then again he could just scoop on turn 1 next game, and I cannot respond to his concede by activating time machine. That right there would hose my combo, and the card altogether. So really you need to do 1 time machine + a reasonable card so your opponent does not scoop.

Heck, it'd render literally every part of a card non-valid, because none of it makes sense in a vaccuum.\nErrata, in the context of MTG, is strictly defined as alterations made to a card after it's gone to print, either for clarity, or because something was broken that they didn't catch. Wormfang Crab is a perfect example; playtesting didn't catch that, if you controlled no creatures and played Wormfang Crab, the game was an instant stalemate, so it was errata'd to fix that.",

Of course, only cards from M10 and Zendakar have that term, so far, and the specific individual card HAS to be physicly printed as part of either set's run. There is no doubt there are a LOT of other fun or powerful tricks that can be pulled with old card wording. How about this (minor) one: while Lifelink abilitys don't stack, cards printed befor Future Sight don't physicaly SAY Lifelink, so these abilitys are no longer Lifelink, and thus stack with Lifelink.\nAlso, the old Mono Artifacts. Now, you can use their abilities without tapping them, as many times as you want a turn. This works because this only restores the old wording, it doesn't restore the old rules. So that rule that says Mono Artifacts must be tapped to play their ability? Still as gone as ever.",

Half of the examples on this comments thread are people trying to alter [i]rules of the game[/i], not errata. I even thought this before when I jumped on the [autocard]Progenitus[/autocard] and this card bandwaggon. Progenitus doesn't actually change, because what \"protection from everything\" means is defined by the rules, specifically 702.15i. Protection from everything is [i]not[/i] defined by errata and is thus not affected by this card. Auras target when the thing they're enchanting when they're on the stack about the enchant them, their target cannot be made anything else; again, part of the rules, not the errata.\nHowever, their are plenty of cards which are probably messed up by this card, such as basic lands when printed without the supertype Basic, legendary creatures are probably no longer affected by the legend rule, [autocard]Frozen Shade[/autocard]'s early versions probably get a permanent pump, etc. [autocard]Floral Spuzzem[/autocard]'s ability probably just fizzles; otherwise, it probably results in a draw given that the choice can never be made and would go to time. I'm not exactly sure how creatures with \"Summon\" instead of the creature type work; they probably don't have summoning sickness, probably can't be targeted by anything that would target creatures, probably can't be used by anything that doesn't target but uses creatures (e.g., convoke), and may not even be able to attack since only creatures can attack. Any talk of Floral Spuzzem being a player that could be targeted by things which target players frankly doesn't make any sense.",

Then use any of the multitude of cards which allow you to alter card types, and use it to change the creature type of TNN from Creature to Planeswalkers. Since players are Planeswalkers, TNN is theoretically a Player. However, it's a 1v1 not a 2v1. Therefore, you can request to have the other player continue for you. Now a TNN who is protected from a judge is playing against your opponent. Since TNN needs assitance, you can perform the necessary actions to help TNN play the game. You can also advertise that you're the only one who can hear TNN's silent talking, so only you can do it, and TNN is telling you to cheat. Since he's protected from that judge, he can't be called out for cheating, or illegal game states. \nYou may proceed to assist True-Name Nemesis to cheat because he's protection from Judge. Also, since it's an unhindged tournament, this will probably be allowed. \nHave fun.",

Just as a gift, he gave me this particular swamp. It is now my favorite land, I actually took out a Zendikar swamp from my favorite deck just so I could put this in. I didn't even think the Un sets were that good, interesting, but hard to build a good deck out of. But if they'd make more lands like this, I'd but out the whole damn set.John Avon, you are awesome.",

Every time you open a foil rare there is one in 41 chance it will be Super Secret Tech (Only comes in rare and there are 41 rares in the block). There are no rares more common then others when a set is released. So 30*41=1230. One in every 1230 packs should give you a super secret tech. 36 booster packs in a box. 1230/36=34.1.
