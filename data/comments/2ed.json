      "content": "A funny, somewhat awe-inspiring  event unfolded in front of me a couple months ago. True story;\nRecently I was at my LGS, talking to a guy who I haven't seen their before. He was probably around  25 or so, and was discussing with me how he hadn't played MTG in a very long time,  seeing as he used to play with his older brother when they were youngsters. He told me how he was walking by the store, saw MTG being advertised and figured he would walk in, see how the game is currently, browse for a second, ect. He told me how he was confused by planeswalkers, sort of thought it seemed like they were taking the place of legendary creatures, and how different the cards look from when he played, ect. Stuff you'd expect from a guy who quit around Legends or so.\nEventually, while he was looking at the display case,  he saw a signed version of this card. His eyes opened wide and his mouth dropped when he saw the price written on the sleeve. It was going for $700.  He then said to me \"Wow, why is that card so expensive?!\" He paused, seemed to ponder something for a moment, looked at the card, and said \"It must have to do with the fact its signed. That makes sense. I have 5 of these back home. There's no way it's worth that much! Do you know how much these go for unsigned? Like what, 20 bucks or something?\". At this point my mouth was probably about twice as wide as when he first noticed the price. I figured I'd help him out as much as I could, not wanting someone to basically steal from him if he ever decided to sell them in a transaction. I told him \"Well, it depends on a lot of factors. The condition matters a lot, but even more important is what set it was from. Do you remember what set it was from at all?\" He responded quickly; \"Yes clearly. The majority of my collection was from the first set, back when the game was brand new. My brother and I opened a ton of these, and I still have at least five copies at my parents house!\"\nI was in awe. This guy had 5 copies of Alpha Ancestral Recall just sitting in his room back home, and according to him many were close to mint condition. So rather than tell him my guess as to the price, I directed him to the store clerk, who is friendly and always willing to look up the price of cards for people in the store. After a moment, the store clerk told the man \"Near mint Alpha Ancestral Recall goes for about... $2000.\" The customer seemed amazed. No, he [i]was[/i] amazed. I talked to him for a few more minutes after that, he seemed to be a very happy camper from then on. Of course, I'm sure I would be too if I just found out I had an extra $10,000 worth of value to my name. I'm just glad I got to help this fellow out before he did something crazy, like sell them for 20 bucks each, and I'd say his overjoyed reaction was plenty payment. I love moments like this and just want to share.\nNow, onto the card itself:\nThis is arguably the most powerful card in the game. I'd say even more so than [autocard]Black Lotus[/autocard] and [autocard]Time Walk[/autocard], though their both undoubtedly close seconds. But they just can't compare to the ridiculously efficient card advantage this card can generate. At instant speed, no less.\nThis card is bonkers.",

In that type of deck, those 3 cards will usually win you the game, you'll scoop moxen, maybe the lotus, a petal, Windfall, Twister, Wheel, Jar, relearn targeting Ancestral. or Time Walk (and at 2 mana it's VERY easy to cast right away) Don't forget the Tutors at 1 black mana for Vampric and 1B for Demonic, and Mystical for a Blue.\nWhile Lotus is great to get in your opening hand or draw in the first 3 turns, Ancestral Recall always kicks supreme butt, 1 Blue for 3 cards as an instant.\nThe Black Lotus got alot of respect from other players, but my Ancestral Recall won me way more games than it ever did.\njust my 2 cents",

Ancestral Recall was in fact common in the FIRST version of Alpha. \nWhen Magic was still being play tested, the first set was called \"Alpha\" but not the one we all know with rounded corners. It was Alpha where walls could attack, and losing all lands of a certain type destroyed all spells of that color. Next came Beta, and then Gamma. After Gamma, came Alpha with the rounded Corners and stuff we know today, then, Another Beta, then Unlimited. The first alpha though not only had Ancestral Recall as a Common, it had Time Walk as a common too, and it was the infamous one that stated \"Opponent loses next turn\". THAT is a fact ;)",

In other words, while this kind of card would merit high priority, it's not something you should shove an important armament aside for.EDIT: I'm getting confused by the people calling card draw strong in and of itself here. Let's try to remember that card advantage in and of itself DOESN'T win games, shall we? It's dependent on what it can bring forth--that's why I said it's just a catalyst. Remember that, yes?@EGarrett01: I think they're trying to find a way to have it do more than JUST net you three more cards.

      "content": "TLDR version: Ancestral Recall>Black Lotus\nFull version:\nFirst, I understand why people would rate this below 5 stars. They don't rate something high because it's powerful: they rate it high because it's fun/balanced/interesting. Fun, this is sometimes. It makes basically any deck that plays the islands playable. At the same time, though, it can be added to an already unbalanced deck and make it nearly. unbeatable, which isn't really fun. Balanced, it is the opposite of. Interesting, it isn't really. How often will this not mean, \"you win the game\"? I rated it 5/5. But I can understand why someone would rate it 1.\nSecond, unrestricted vintage is a casual format I play (using proxies) with some of my friends. In it, the best deck is actually NOT storm combo decks and other crazy combo decks that go off on turn 1 90% of the time, though they do exist. The best is an esper control deck. Watch: \nStorm player tries to go off turn 1 on the play, something they can do pretty reliably. The opponent starts with Gemstone Caverns on the battlefield. They cast Ancestral Recall during the opponent's upkeep. \"Tendrils of Agony.\" \"Mindbreak Trap.\" \"Go.\" Their turn: \"Island, Black Lotus, Jace, the Mindsculptor. I'll Brainstorm.\" \nJust saying, the best cards in the game, as evidenced by the fact that it makes up the best deck in Vintage without a restricted list, is not a Mox, or Time Walk, or Tinker, or Black Lotus. It's Ancestral Recall and Jace. Magic is weird. \nThird, Here's why this is better than Black Lotus: Black lotus adds 3 mana. This gives you 3 cards. Would you ever play a card that cost 1 and did nothing, but just draw you a card? No, you wouldn't. You have better cards than THAT. therefore, 1 card is better than 1 mana. For that reason, Ancestral Recall, which gets you 3 cards, is better than Black Lotus, which gets you 3 mana. Just in case someone else thinks of this, the cost to make something instant speed is either 1 or U. Therefore, the ability to cast Ancestral at instant speed makes up for the greater cost. \nFinally, on the subject of Unrestricted Vintage, it's a VERY different format from restricted Vintage. It's basically divided into combo decks that go off on turn 1 95% of the time or higher, and decks designed to combat them. The problem with combo, however, is that you can only rarely spend any card slots on disruption or protection, because sacrificing speed for resilience is actually a bad investment. Basically, every game is decided on the first turn, which is a single blindingly fast turn of tremendous interaction. I've played many games in this format, and the speed tradeoff for having spaces open for counters and discard, as supposed to card draw, tutors, and fast mana, is just not a good one. What that means is that control decks running about 20 free counters are the top of the food chain, and not the broken combo decks.",

But on turn 1, as with Black Lotus, is a lot more. 3 extra cards on turn 5 is a something completely different than 3 extra mana since mana in late game becomes much less of an issue and not at all as important (especially with temporary mana), card draw on the other hand is never invalid. As such I don't think it's an entirely fair to compare these two cards in order to answer wether or not BL or AR is the better card.",

When you DO draw it in your first hand it can't kill your opponent by itself, but it is THE KEY to many first turn kills. When judging this card put it in the context in which it was created. Look at the Alpha, Beta, or Unlimited lists and see the limited # of cards that actually existed then. Magic is really just a death race and this baby is the king of speed.",

      "content": "As a long time player and owner of one of these, I think I'm qualified to comment regarding those on both sides of this issue, those who think this is the greatest card in all of magic and those who think it's terribly overrated or even flat out bad.\nThe truth of this lies somewhere in the middle if you're going to be objective about this.\nVersatility wise, this is one of the few cards, that can be utilized by just about any deck...provided the person constructing the deck understands the synergy between this and his other cards and how to use it. I could easily throw this card into a deck where it would be close to useless or of minimum assistance.\nYou still have to know how to play this game...something a lot of people don't.\nSo this card, by itself, is not the be all and end all. It still needs other cards to win. Can it get you to where you want to go faster than any other card? Depends on the deck. I have one in one deck, with my other Power 9 cards (I have the whole set) that was specifically made to make the most use of this card.\nI do NOT have it in my red burn deck where this card would be a mild boost on turn 1 (lightning bolt and incinerate for 0) and not much else. It just doesn't fit in that deck. If it can't get something out that gets to stay out and actually change the complexion of the match, it's power is limited. In that deck, I'd rather have an Ancestral Recall in my hand to fill it up faster after using my burn spells. But even that doesn't fit if I'm playing mono red.\nPoint is, the deck you put together is what wins...not this card and for that matter, not any one card.\nMy Voltaic Key/Time Vault deck. It isn't Voltaic Key and Time Vault by themselves that win the game. It's all the artifact tutors that allow me to grab those cards quickly that win me the game unless I'm lucky enough to draw them in my opening hand.\nAnd therein lies the problem with the \"best card in the game\" crowd, especially for cards that are restricted. As a former math major, given a deck of 60 cards and only one of a given card in it, drawing 7 cards your first turn and going first, you roughly have a little better than 10% chance of getting that card in your opening hand. If you're depending on that ONE card to win the game for you or give you that edge where you have a better chance of winning down the road, you are playing a fool's deck.\nI see so many people talking about all these great combos for 1 and 2 turn kills. Too bad the odds of getting those combos, especially the 3 and 4 card ones, are slim to none.\nMy Black Lotus is a bonus for me if I pull it in my opening hand. It allows me to play a 6/6 flier by turn 2 and sometimes even turn 1 depending on how many moxen I draw.\nBut if I relied on that draw to win, I'd be dead.\nSo the deck is loaded with counterspells.\nIn fact, here is my deck construction.\n4 Force Of Will\n4 Counterspell\n4 Mana Drain\n4 Arcane Denial\n4 Control Magic\n3 Man-o-War\n2 Sphinx of Magosi\n1 Stormtide Leviathan\n1 Jin-Gitaxias Core Auger\n1 Time Walk\n1 Timetwister\n1 Ancestral Recall\n1 Mystical Tutor\n1 Mox Pearl\n1 Mox Sapphire\n1 Mox Jet\n1 Mox Ruby\n1 Mox Emerald\n1 Black Lotus\n1 Panoptic Mirror\n1 Isochron Scepter\n1 Traumatize\n20 Island\nThere isn't one card in this deck that I absolutely depend on to win. In fact, I have so many win conditions in this deck it's sick. If I can counter all your spells long enough to drop a Magosi or Leviathan it's game over in a few turns after. If a creature gets by me, I'll Control Magic it or pop it back in your hand with a Man-o-War. If I can pop a Panoptic Mirror and a Time Walk, I'll take infinite turns.\nI used to have a Jace in this deck but took him out because I didn't really need him to win.\nThis deck wins 70% of it's games.\nI can count on one hand the number of those games decided because I popped a Lotus.\nFolks, it's not a one card game. It never was. Having said that, not understanding how important cards like Black Lotus are shows how little you really understand this game.\nIt takes 60 cards to win...not one, not two...60\nThose of you propping this up on a royal throne need to understand that.\nI'll take a Shrine Of Burning Rage (actually 4 of them) in my burn deck over a Black Lotus any day of the week.\nConversely, in the deck I listed above, Shrine Of Burning Rage is a waste of deck space.\nIt's all about deck construction.\nAnd Black Lotus is just one great card out of a deck of maybe 12 great cards if you've put a deck together worth its salt.\nAnd even great decks can have crappy draws. That's why on any given day, one good deck can beat a great deck.\nThat's why you still have to play the game.\nAs it should be.\nBlack Lotus?\n5/5 or 1/5 depending on where you put it",

But hey, it means amusement for the rest of us.\nBlack Lotus is a utility card. Plain and simple. It provides you three mana of any one color as early as turn one, and there are what must be, like, dozens of ways to win that first turn, if you have this utility card in a deck worth its salt. Yes, some people say \"you need a good deck to use it though!!1eleven!  But the point is, THAT'S HOW ANY DECK WORKS. God, people. There is no such thing as an invincible card. Even in the B.L.'s case, you need it turn one or two, and you need to be competent to not only build a deck that can utilize it, but also to have the brains to comprehend what you're trying to do. I admit, not a lot of people can really do that, and I don't know if that's good or bad for the game. But, I'm happy to know that some people, like a few on this thread, know what the hell they're doing when considering this card for their deck.\nSo yeah. Utility and damn good utility at that. If you don't like it, fine. I'll try not to laugh at you when you finally come across this card, say \"oh yeah, 3 mana for 0 is stupid I'll kill it with [autocard]Shatter[/autocard]\", and then proceed to die on turn 0 to a card you thought was crap, or didn't like because the price on its head was too much, or because you're a sniveling idiot with more cardboard than brain matter.\n/Rant",

If your good or experienced, you think it is completely broken. Black Lotus is hands down the best card in the game. It is a crime that this thing is not 5 stars. It is (as someone else said) the Holy Grail of [b]Magic[/b].\nSome may argue that other members of the Power 9 and other good cards are the best. Mainly, [autocard]Ancestral Recall[/autocard] and [autocard]Time Walk[/autocard]. While these cards break the game in half as well, they can't be put into any deck the way that the Black Lotus can. Technically, you can but they wont be good if your playing non-blue. Black Lotus improves any deck.\nSome of the people who rate this down are upset about the massive price tag and how the they can't be competitive in Vintage without it. If you don't want to pay thousands of dollars on cards, go play Legacy. Its banned there, I believe (I'm not a tournament player) so just have fun there. Don't get mad at cards like these. Don't be mad at the original creators either, the game was in its infancy. Its different nowadays where Wizards already knows how to balance the game but still print cards like [autocard]Baneslayer Angel[/autocard] or [autocard]Jace, the Mind Sculptor[/autocard]. If you don't like those cards go ahead and rate them down. Be my guest. But don't be mad at this little flower, it didn't know better.",

If we see a new lotus in Besieged or Action then It will likely work around metal craft and Imprint.\nIt would look like:\nMetal Lotus    {0}\nLegendary Artifact\n[i]Imprint[/i] - Exile a basic land from your hand.\n[i]Metalcraft[/i] - {T}: Sacrifice Metal Lotus to add 3 mana of same kind the exiled card could produce.  Activate this ability only if you control three or more Artifacts.\nA deck may only have one Metal lotus.\nPlaying with other 0 costed artifacts means getting this out on the first turn kills the hand to 3. It could always be made colorless non artifact to kill your hand to two.  Which may need to be necessary for peeps playing with Mox Opal and Black lotus.\nFor anyone else who doesn't notice: BlackLotusisTerrible is just trolling.

First Turn Kills aren't fun, and should only ever be used in hyper-competitive money-situations. This card provides little more than a one-turn mega-boost, which at only three mana, can do little to actually progress the game early on UNLESS being used in some raunchy FTK combo; unless you use it to play like, mana flare or something. Good card, I'd definitely like to own one, but there are a huge list of cards I'd rather own and get much more enjoyment out of. Probably just the Spike-hating Johnny in me though, so feel free to eat me alive; I just don't find it amusing or worth my time when a whole game is just \"shuffle your deck, reveal your opening hand, explain why you already won and neither person should have wasted their time or money to play glorified Rock-Paper-Scissors\"",

As people have said before me, its restricted so you can only have 1 in your deck, but droping turn 1 for 0 mana to gain 3 of any color is a hell of a deal all its own, not counting the many devestating combos one can come up with for this holy grail of mtg. i forget the exact combo, but using the Power 9 (black lotus is obviously one of them), one would be able to swing for 20+ with a [autocard]Shivan Dragon[/autocard] before an oponent even  had a chance to play ther first land.

That it has been and always will be, the Icon of all magic players? Even today, many years after magic debuted, BL is still the most desired card for all collections and makes any deck better just by having it included.

However, the idea of magic is to get mana out to play your stuff, and the more mana you have, the more stuff you  can do and the more dangerous you become to your opponent. a total of 4 mana on your first turn is increadible, and combining it with a couple of dark rituals or any other card like that, and youc an effectively play an eldrazi or bigger before your opponent even gets their first turn.

Black Lotus is just such one of these cards, and while it's *potential* is simply screamingly powerful, it *looks* like the Vintage players of today don't just slam it in lists because they own it- Oh they DO run it, a lot, but also, I've seen WINNING decklists for Vintage that use mana and do not use Black Lotus- why not then?\n[autocard]Chalice of the Void[/autocard] is an Anti-0 cost Hate Tech in Vintage. I don't think it's the explanation, but I mention that card more as a question than a statement- do that, Null Rod and other hate really account for anything less than 100% of Vintage decks that aren't manaless playing Black Lotus and Moxen?\nI think it just might have to do with the fact that it's not *really* a permanent- it's 0-cost and its only use is to sacrifice itself, so firstly it's more like a \"Paradise Ritual\", and secondly...well, I don't have a secondly, except that maybe it's so rare that not everyone is using it because not everyone has one. Yeah, ok that makes sense too. I know there's that wierd manaless deck out there, but theoretically every deck that plays mana should play this.\nReally, REALLY notably, I see that Goblin Decks practically NEVER use either Black Lotus OR Mox Ruby. It might be that rarity of the card is an issue, but somehow this seems less likely when I KNOW Goblin Decks have actually won really major tournaments- which would give the winner the money to get a Black Lotus or at least a Mox Ruby. \nCan anyone tell me why some Vintage Decks do not use the on-color Power Nine? Especially why Mox Ruby is not played in Goblins?\nUntil then, I'm going to suggest that Black Lotus is actually a 4.85-4.9 card, because if it were a 5 card, every deck in Vintage piloted by a person with funds would have one. (Except Manaless decks, of course)\nSomething tells me that most (not all) of the people who think Black Lotus is 5/5 don't understand something about Vintage and wouldn't be able to win a Vintage game even if someone gave them a free deck that recently placed under a knowledgeable pilot. Of the people that both really know about Vintage *and* would put Black Lotus as 5/5, could someone talk about the Pro's opinion of it and shed some light on this?",

Anyways about the card, it used to be the staple of all our decks, unless we were playing in a fun group deck you really used it for every deck you wanted to be competitive with.  It was most effective for quick starts.  It wasn't too far fetched to draw a Lotus, a Mox, a Sol Ring, and a strip mine on the first turn, giving you 6 mana and just use the Strip Mine to scrub your opponents first land.  Even when buried within your library, the three free mana of any color most always provided utility, usually on multi-colored decks. \ni read how people would love to have one, and i understand.  They were fun, but even back in the day when they were still obtainable, people understood they were sort of ridiculous in terms of it's power.  And it's probably best that they are so expensive now it would be ridiculous to use on in play.",

That means it gives you some virtual card advantage, although that is negated by the fact that you lose the lotus in the process, so the net card advantage is 0 (sort of). What Black Lotus really gives you is incredible tempo. With just this one little piece of cardboard, you can be turns ahead of your opponent(s). And that is why it is so good.Would I first pick it in MTGO Online Cube? Maybe, maybe not, depending on what else I were to choose from.",

I think that perhaps that someday, somewhere, somebody part of your imaginary T2 hasn't nor ever will happen as long as you have to have two mana. So I'm nitpicky and busted apart your \"wow\" factor comment. Sue me.\n@goldwing8 First of all, this is a great place to learn about cards' strengths and weaknesses, and with that type of community comes a popular (not always varied) or several popular opinions as to the pros and cons of a particular card. In this case, you might have some difficulty finding someone who will tell you \"Eh, Black Lotus sucks,\" or the ever incredible reply of \"I don't get it. All it does is give you mana?\"\nWell, if you don't know or took a long time to learn like I did, let me tell you now: In Magic, mana is king. The King. I'm sure multiple, more experienced long-time players could show me multiple cards that say something like \"No mana, win the game!\" or who knows what else. After all, cards this good exist (but this is arguably one of the best - if not the very best - cards in the game). Why? Essentially free mana. No, you can't play the Lotus as an instant by itself, it doesn't work like the [autocard]Chromatic Lantern[/autocard], is very similar to [autocard]Gilded Lotus[/autocard] which also gives you three, but isn't sacrificed. Just think of it as a free mana bomb. For nothing, you can on your turn play a card which lets you at any time get three additional mana for whatever. Someone tries to kill your artifact? If you have an instant, play it anyway so they waste their mana. Want to be able to play a counterspell during your opponent's turn but already tapped all your mana? Black Lotus.\nAnyway, if you read this, I'm sure you get the point by now. Either that or I'm terrible at anything and everything and will cry myself to sleep this Christmas outside my local magic store.",

Before the concept of tempo became so deeply entrenched in every player's mind, when the game was newly designed, the above actually seems pretty reasonable. There are many board games and video games in which something that generates you some resource every turn is worth a lot more than something that provides resource just once. If you have 500 gold, you can recruit a calvary or two; if you have a gold silo that gives you 100 gold every minute, it can fuel your whole army during the entire game. Of course, in those real time strategy games, you can't use that 500 gold to perform some sequence of actions that kills all your opponents within a minute, or get to a vastly superior position where coming back is nigh impossible. Turns out in Magic you can.",

      "content": "How fitting that my first random card comment of the day lands me on a card originating in Alpha! What I love about this card is the way that they went about establishing colour hosers back in the day. While Blue Elemental Blast is far too powerful by today's standards, it was important to establish that the enemies colours in Magic weren't just theoretical or philosophical enemies. Blue absolutely hated red, and they were equipped to punish red mages with extreme severity. \nThis was also printed alongside Red Elemental Blast, and while players and designers alike enjoy symmetry in card design, it allowed design to push the limits of the basic colour pie they had established. \nIn fact, the symmetry between the elemental blasts was something so beautiful, it was 12 years ahead of its time. By deciding to have create both of these cards, they were able to take the countermagic from blue and the destruction from red, and form it into a single entity. Whether they realized what they were doing or not, the original designers created the first hybrid spell, Elemental Blast, and then broke it in half as hybrid mana didn't exist yet. They each may have an ability that seemed a little out of place, but when you're establishing the colour wheel for the first time it's not such a bad thing to say \"Blue may not be in the business of destroying permanents, but for you we'll make an exception.\"\nOh yeah, and it's a good thing that interrupts don't exist anymore, because destroy effects at interrupt speed? Not cool, man.",

The color ward cycle can best be examined as artistic interventions against the oppressive humor archetype, whereas the unappealingly desperate musings of Dan Frazier's eponymous series are truly indebted to Jenny Holzer’s oeuvre. Or, as Baudrillard and Guillaume so succinctly state, \"What is produced with the romantic turn…is…the…play of…masculine hysteria…of …sexual paradigms that once again must be reinserted in the more general and universal context of a change in the paradigms of otherness.\"",

Then simply release my thumb and let the card flop, worked like a charm EVERY single time.\nAnd i sold all the card in my collection, and i don't even want to speculate how much they would be worth today, i know a huge amount.  But i have no regrets really, but the one card i do regret not keeping is one Chaos Orb i owned which i had signed by Mark Tedin at a convention in Seattle.  i asked him if he could not only sign it, but add a cartoonish caption above the artwork with the words \"Bleeeeaaahhh\", just as if you could hear the beast vomiting lava.  He looked at me kind of funny at first, but he was totally cool, and signed it like that, and we both got a good laugh at the notion.  Yah i wish i would have kept that one...",

Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.\n613.7a An effect is said to \"depend on\" another if (a) it's applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect (see rules 613.1 and 613.3); (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.\n613.7b An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they're applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.[/i]\nBoth the effects of [autocard]Blood Moon[/autocard] and Conversion apply in the 4th Layer, and Conversion is dependent on Blood Moon, so timestamp order is overridden.  So we apply Blood Moon first, making all nonbasic lands into Mountains, and then we apply Conversion, turning all Mountains (including the former nonbasic lands) into Plains.",

So if you have three Taigas or three Stomping Grounds (as tavaritz and MTGFreak suggest), you do get a total of three red and three green mana. Of course you could also take red mana from these dual lands, but in any case, with three Taigas or Stomping Grounds, you end up having six mana, of which at least three is red.",

Why are the moxes powerful? well on their own each mox is a boost for speed mana, which is powerful (not broken) what makes them broken is using all 5 in the same deck, plus those newer ones Diamond, Opal and the Chrome.\nit's like playing 4 lightning bolts, you draw 1 and bolt the guy he's at 17 (still alot of life) you play another from your opening hand he's at 14, the more bolts the more effective the resault. The same goes for Moxes,  when your opening hand is..\nMox Emerald, Any land, Mox Diamond, any other land, Wheel of Fortune, (and 2 whatever cards, could be counterspell and Force of Will)\nyou drop a land, drop the Emerald, drop the Diamond and ditch a land, tap them play Wheel\nYou just hosed your opponent, they discard 7 and you both draw 7 new cards.  At this point you've only played 2 moxes out of 8 (1 copy of each in the deck plus a Lotus) what are your chances of drawing more? pretty good, you can also draw more draw cards like Timetwister, Windfall, Memory Jar, Ancestral Recall plus you could be playing with Lotus Pedal, Dark Ritual's and such for even more lightspeed mana.\nMoxes are called power for a reason. And for anyone wanting to say \"oh those opening hands don't happen\" guess again, rare opening hands were when we didn't do anything broken on the first turn.",

And now that the titans have been reprinted in 2012, supply went up by twice the amount in the rules of supply and demand. \nSince I have originally read this post a few months ago, unlimited mox jet has increased in price by like 50 bucks (to 450 for one in decent shape) and primeval titan is down to 15 with grave titan at 10 (both in 2012, I mean). So that's a trade for a 100 dollar bucket of 8 cards for one 450 dollar card.\nIn other words....whoever made that trade must be kicking themself super hard right now. NEVER trade power 9s. Only trade/sell those when you want to quit Magic and need to buy an engagement ring and need to make some fast cash :) ...or if you need to pay off The Mob.\nJeez, I'd never even think to trade my unlimited mox jet (5/5 on this card btw) for a playset of Jace 2.0! And that was even before they were banned! It's just not worth it. Sure, it's fun to win a lot in standard. But it's even more fun to drop a mox on the table...even if it's just a casual game (since I can't seem to find any vintage tournaments....I mean, I can, but they usually allow like 15 proxies. Where's the fun in that for the people with real honesttagod pieces of power?)",

I've actually held decks in my hand that had 12 Time Walk, 15 Moxes, and so on, and they were a lot of fun to play, but when these were eventually restricted to 4 in a deck, people thought that was tough because you couldn't load up on them and go off in a single turn anymore.\nThe reason these aren't the same as a basic land is simple:\nThese are played in Type1, and the first turn, being able to play a Land, then Moxes or Lotus cards, gives you enough because they cost 0 to then cast like 4 Dark Ritual, then cast the Storm card of choice for a win in one shot. Even before that, they were useful because you can only play one land a turn unless you cast either Fastbond or Exploration, and even then, Strip Mine is prevalent, and you aren't going to keep everything. So these give a major speed boost in what you can cast.\nAlso, with things like this and Tidespout Tyrant, you can play one, then another, over and over again, and gain infinite Storm count, in one turn. You can't do that with a Basic land.",

He killed me with that card as I was able to take ONE turn before losing.\nIt's one thing to think stupid the month you start playing, it's another to have your butt handed to you by someone who knows better and uses these. The reason Moxes and Black Lotus cost so much money for doing the same thing as a basic land, is because they add SPEED. What deck doesn't work better when it's faster? All decks in every game you've ever played, would have been quicker with 5 Moxes and a Lotus, because instead of you playing a land and maybe one spell, you could play a land, 2 Moxes, a Lotus, and pop out Mahamoti Djinn on the VERY first turn you took. That's a pretty damn big threat on turn 0. And that's only an example of what I've personally watched.",

My opponent's turn two he played a Plains and a [autocard]Timetwister[/autocard]. With a new hand he played 2 [autocard]Mox Sapphire[/autocard]s and played another [autocard]Time Walk[/autocard]. He took an extra turn, played an [autocard]Island[/autocard] and played [autocard]Goliath Sphinx[/autocard].*groans*. Then it was my turn I played a [autocard]Forest[/autocard] and played a  [autocard]Horned Troll[/autocard]. Then my opponent's turn he played a [autocard]Mox Pearl[/autocard] and [autocard]Eldrazi Conscription[/autocard] and had a 18/17 creature with trample, flying and annihilator 2. He attacked with the Sphinx and the Monster and made me sacrifice both my creatures. I was down to 5 life. THen nothing I did helped. This is a really fast game and I'm not jokin'!\nSee what Moxen can do?!\n5/5(And sorry for spamming lol)",

      "content": "A quick lesson in Moxes....\nMoxes are power people, I've used them all, even before the restricting rules came out. Why are the moxes powerful? well on their own each mox is a boost for speed mana, which is powerful (not broken) what makes them broken is using all 5 in the same deck, plus those newer ones Diamond, Opal and the Chrome.\nit's like playing 4 lightning bolts, you draw 1 and bolt the guy he's at 17 (still alot of life) you play another from your opening hand he's at 14, the more bolts the more effective the resault. The same goes for Moxes,  when your opening hand is..\nMox Ruby, Any land, Mox Diamond, any other land, Wheel of Fortune, (and 2 whatever cards, could be counterspell and Force of Will)\nyou drop a land, drop the Ruby , drop the Diamond and ditch a land, tap then play Wheel\nYou just hosed your opponent, they discard 7 and you both draw 7 new cards.  At this point you've only played 2 moxes out of 8 (1 copy of each in the deck plus a Lotus) what are your chances of drawing more? pretty good, you can also draw more draw cards like Timetwister, Windfall, Memory Jar, Ancestral Recall plus you could be playing with Lotus Pedal, Dark Ritual's and such for even more lightspeed mana.\nMoxes are called power for a reason. And for anyone wanting to say \"oh those opening hands don't happen\" guess again, rare opening hands were when we didn't do anything broken on the first turn.",

I mean, it'd be better if it were a lower cost, but then we'd have a situation like Leatherback Baloth. Its effect could be used for good, like if you're attacked by a 8/6 and you don't want your Incarnation destroyed, you'd prevent 3 damage, leaving him alive minus a few life points. That'd be excellent if you still want to defend with it. It's almost like its got a regeneration, except it costs life... which SUCKS. Joking. But still, I think it's a little under-rated. 3.5 stars for me.",

I guess the theory was that you were supposed to gain tons of life to keep this alive and then gradually wear your way through the enemy's defenses... except that cards like Terror already existed, as did regenerators, which stop this guy cold.\nStill, I'd like to see an improved version of this card return - just by stripping away the \"lose half your life' drawback, and maybe dropping the casting cost to 4WW, one could get an interesting creature that would actually make lifegain somewhat amusing.",

      "content": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #78, 6/6/11[/b]\nOf all the rules changes that went into effect with [b]Magic 2010[/b], the one I continue to get email about is the removal of mana burn (combat damage on the stack died a relatively quiet death). The mail is not from people that want their opponents to lose a random point for tapping their [autocard]Birds of Paradise[/autocard] in response to a [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard], but rather people that occassionally try to win the game via mana burn with cards like this one.\nIn a world with mana burn, Power Surge puts an opponent without spells to cast into a no-win situation: either he taps his lands for mana or he doesn’t; either way causes him to take a damage per land. With mana burn gone, all the opponent has to do is tap all his lands to avoid Power Surge’s damage.\nI’ve played with this card a bit, as well as with cards like it such as [autocard]Eladamri's Vineyard[/autocard] and [autocard]Spectral Searchlight[/autocard]; even [autocard]Mana Flare[/autocard] could cause enough stray burn to affect a game’s outcome.\nThe game did lose something with the loss of mana burn, I acknowledge that. But I still think the rule wasn’t worth having around. Now that it doesn’t exist, players aren’t just tapping lands willy-nilly and floating mana without repercussion just to mess with each other (at least not players I’ve interacted with), which was one fear of removing it. Occasionally a [autocard]Cabal Coffers[/autocard] or [autocard]Gaea's Cradle[/autocard] will over-perform and no punishment is meted out, but that’s hardly a big loss. In return, newer players never need lectured on the hidden dangers of their own mana producers.\n[autocard]Mogg Fanatic[/autocard] changed from “great” to “good” as opposed to “useless” with the M10 rules, and it is still played in most of the decks that wanted it before. Power Surge wasn’t as fortunate. Even a permission player can just tap all his lands during your end step to avoid the damage. So we must be creative. My first thought is combining the card with [autocard]Winter Orb[/autocard] or [autocard]Manabarbs[/autocard] or any other card that punishes you for tapping lands. I’m sure there’s some other use for this card out there still—that’s the beauty of the game.",

Combine with other blue control cards, PB is very dangerous, compare to Char is already in a damage-abundant color.

That is EXACTLY WHAT RED WANTS TO BE DOING. Psionic Blast just does not impact a match in the same way Char does.I will give that Psionic Blast still sees play in Legacy/Vintage blue aggro decks (three of in a winning Hexproof build, consistent one of in Merfolk builds), but it is not format defining the way Char was in its Standard time.",

Too bad that in this day and age, even a 1/1 unblockable won't get you to your victory, most of the time.  Thus, for Shanodin Dryads, we're left with the artwork and not much else outside of a forest/nature theme deck.Alternatives, for those inclined: Somberwald Dryad, the 2/2 upgrade of this very card. Wormwood Dryad, for those who dabble in the darker arts and want to maximize their dryad-based damage.  Yavimaya Dryad, the most fun dryad of all, in my humble opinion, which serves to either lead you to new leafy domains, or sneak into the enemy's.",

He was low on life with a Dark Confidant on the board and was afraid that if he was actually made to take the turns, the Confidant would kill him before he found his win condition.

Twiddle, Voltaic Key)\n12-16 lands that produce blue and/or colorless mana\n12-16 mana generating artifacts or creatures (Black Lotus)\n6-8 counterspells or recalling spells (Unsummon, Cancel)\n2 Solarion\nThen, on your average hand you may (1) play Black Lotus and a land, play Time Vault and Twiddle and then tap for another turn; or if you're not so lucky (2) play a land and mana-generating artifacts, use the mana to play a card-fetch or card-draw spell so that you get cards like Time Vault and Black Lotus, then play the Black Lotus to put Time Vault into play, then tap the land to play Twiddle; or if you're really unlucky, (3) rinse and repeat. \nI've never actually assembled such a deck but it's conceivable to get 50-80% chance of getting an extra turn, [b]on turn one[/b], and after that your chance of getting to go again (and again) only rises from there on. Which translates into a 40-80% chance of winning before the opponent gets to go, and a 80-90% chance of winning before the opponent's second turn. Play with Solarion, then bide your (infinite) time as the Solarion from five turns ago goes from a 1/1 to a 32/32 (or even faster if you have more untapper creatures/artifacts to spare). \nSo yeah...

A lot of people say this can't be true, as on its own, Time Vault is considerably horrid. But, what about the Moxen? Black Lotus? Oh, they're good, but they require other cards to be put to full effect, just like the Vault. \nThat said, I think people are blowing this out of proportion. There are certainly answers to this card once played, and while you might have to be prepared and in the end somewhat lucky, things like a single green could very well ruin the Combo player's day once he has an active Vault. That's the beauty of [b]Magic[/b]: there is no single perfect card. Black lotus goes away after tapped. The Moxen can be shut down by a turn 0 Chalice of the Void for 0 mana down payment. Lightning Bolt and Ancestral Recall can be countered. Force of Will needs another card and life point to really be broken.\nThese are all simple examples, and a very small sample of the vast, vast game that we (hopefully) have come to love. In the end, I love this card to death, but I know that if I come prepared, I don't have to scoop the moment it hits the field on the other guy or gal's side.\nSo yeah.

If you ever played magic in the early days or against a vintage blue deck, there is really nothing worse then surviving time walk and ancestral recall, only to have them reinserted into the library and your opponent draws 7 new cards.

Draw 7 is a very important part of Vintage, and this is by far the best of any Draw 7 card there is, for Vintage, at least, the eternal format with the highest power level in Magic. Resolving a Timetwister does far more than resolving a Mox/Lotus/Walk/Recall. People are forgetting the effect that it has on your opponent, one of the biggest boons of Timetwister. I'm absolutely certain that people don't understand the Vintage meta, as this will irrevocably damage Stax, and completely shut down Ichorid, two popular Vintage mainstays. This will downright hose any graveyard/recursion based deck, and it is more than just an incredible sideboard for decks like Fish. It is one bomb that refills your hand and shuts down your opponent in one go.",

I would say basically that this card, on top of allowing you some very impressive combos, is like a Wrath of God or a Balance;  it can twist the game entirely in your favor depending on what you get in your new hand, or it can help you simply refill your hand with a possibility of playing again those restricted cards you've already played or it can screw you if your opponents draw better hands than yours.  All in all, I say it's a very valuable card and allowed me to win so many games and was the key to so much fun combos that I love it very much, especially with Tormod's Crypt or effects alike.  :p",

Maybe 50 games, using Timetwister and Underworld Dreams.\nAnd for the guy who said Wheel of Fortune does almost the same... No! Wheel of Fortune makes you discard your hand and draw 7 new cards, and Timetwister has the dual purpose of not only refilling your hand, but putting all your resources BACK IN YOUR DECK! How the hell can someone compare that to one that you draw 7 and that's it with?\nI have a deck with 4 Underworld Dreams, and with no Black Lotus or Moxes, and just Dark Rituals, they can come out REALLY fast, and not only that, they are all only 3 casting cost. You cast Timetwister and they have to take 28 damage for 3 Mana.\nWheel of Fortune is good for this too because you can add in Megrim and make them take a lot of damage, but Timetwister is better because you get all the cards back from your graveyard!\nAlso, a Vercursion deck, Timetwister is one of the most important cards in that deck. You use it to gain infinite life and Mana, and you get to put all your resources back in the deck instead of not getting them back at all.\nI agree with the guy who was talking about thinking it was crap at first until he played against someone with it who knew what they were doing. In the right deck this card is WAY more powerful than Time Walk.\nthink about it like this:\nIf you're playing a game and your not getting what you need, and you need to reboot your deck, this is the only way.",

Blue players tend to hold certain cards in their hand, waiting for the opportune moment to play them, and they don't usually bolster their defenses with many creatures.  So what does this really do for a blue player who's holding a full hand of cards with few creatures in play?  Firstly, because blue players have full or nearly full hands, this card doesn't truly offer card advantage, since it requires you to dump your hand into your library.  It doesn't let you plan how you will play your next turns, since you have no clue what your new hand will look like.  Lastly, it does nothing to affect the state of the battlefield, so if your opponent is overwhelming you with creatures, you're still left in a dismal state after this resolves.  \nThis just isn't a very blue card when you consider how it spits in the face of the blue player's virtues of defense, planning, and card advantage.  Upheaval covers blue's bases much more, I think.  Also, Time Spiral is clearly better than this card.",

While Time Spiral is twice as expensive to cast, this really isn't much of a drawback because the effects of this spell are more useful in the middle stages of the game than they are right out of the gate.  Also, Time Spiral, at the very least, pays for itself.  If you factor in a Tolarian Academy, Gaea's Cradle or any other land spitting out multiple mana, Time Spiral becomes a mana accelerator as well.  So, you have better odds of being able to play other things after Time Spiral resolves.",

      "content": "While I agree that Timetwister is an amazing card, and incredibly powerful even on its own.....\nI don't think it would be Power 9 IF IT WEREN'T that the rest of Blue is so good. Let me try to explain- \nof course, in the context of the rest of the cards we know, it has been tried and tested and proved to be ZONKERS.  Also, it is VERY DIFFICULT to imagine completely outside of the context of other cards, especially when thinking IN CONTEXT, its abundantly clear how super great this is.\nBut, lets think for a moment- compare Time Warp to Time Reversal. Time Reversal was charged only 2 more mana than this. Time Warp was charged almost triple the price of the original Time Walk. Time Warp is STILL great in just about ANY blue deck. Time Reversal? Did not stand the test of Time (pardon the pun) too well.  This card is GREAT card, there is just no doubts there---\nBut a lot of what makes the Power 9 so GROSSLY OVERPOWERED is that, let us be frankly honest here- they are stupendously undercosted. Really egregiously so. Some later cards, however, proved that some of the effects of the Power 9 were STILL just amazingly good, EVEN after you tried costing them more restrictively. [autocard]Lotus Bloom[/autocard] is such a card. [autocard]Time Warp[/autocard] is such a card. [autocard]Ancestral Vision[/autocard], [autocard]Mox Diamond[/autocard], and [autocard]Mox Opal[/autocard] are also great. Even [autocard]Visions of Beyond[/autocard] looks like its going to be a big hit, and we all know about [autocard]Brainstorm[/autocard].\nIs it really fair of me to judge this card by its strictly worse counterparts? If I wanted to say 'this specific card is bad' because of that, I'd be wrong. Instead, I'm trying to say, 'the basic effect of this card has been proven to be the weakest of the Power 9 effects, and I believe that most of Timetwister's power comes from its undercostedness, and I FURTHER suggest that this is NOT the case with the other Power 9, since their abilities have been put on heavier costing cards and have STILL been some of the most powerful cards in the game- ESPECIALLY Brainstorm and Lotus Petal.\nIf this sounds wrong to you, please explain to me why Time Reversal is so much weaker than the other 'Fixed Power' cards. I think the others would be Power 9 even if you bumped all their mana costs up by exactly 1. Would Timetwister be P9 at 3U? at 2UU? Maybe. Maybe not.\nTo appease Timetwister fans, I will close by making it clear that because it Is costed at merely 2U, it's ridiculously stupidly amazing and it's definitely Power 9 material.",

Contrast that to Time Walk and Ancestral Recall, which would never be sideboard material - maindeck for life - and you see there is a big difference between a powerful card (like this one), and a Power 9 card.In my opinion, and the opinion of most classically famous Type 1 players, the actual 9th card of the Power 9 is Sol Ring, for the same reasons as the moxes and lotus.  The only reason it's not obvious is that Sol Ring didn't hold the same rarity.  Consider that in terms of raw power, a Sol Ring quite frequently can be more potent than an off-color mox (not on that turn, but for the rest of the game), and it's harder to kill one with Gorilla Shaman as well.",

Mind you, any blue deck worth it's salt will easily be able to abuse it. That said, holy monkeyball flipping jesus is this an unbelievable card.",

Just play all Lotuses from your hand, sac them for blue mana and cast Timetwister (bringing the used Lotuses back to your library). Repeat until you have enough mana to either kill your opponent with fireball or mill him with Braingeyser. The Braingeyser variant also allows you to draw your entire deck when you have enough mana, after which you should have at least 60 mana in pool (from your 20 Lotuses).",

If this card is not good enough for you, then exactly what is??  There is no drawback to playing a dual land, only a bonus, making it strictly superior to all those basic lands we would normally fill our deck with.Dual Lands may not be the most significant cards you can play, but when it comes to rating them there really should be no hesitation.

There were exceptions for artifacts having untap costs (Mana Vault, Basalt Monolith, Time Vault) or specifically doing something when tapped (Mana Vault). Of course it didn't usually didn't matter with mono artifacts, since they needed to tap to activate.EDIT: Just for clarification, the rule of non-creature artifacts not working if tapped existed even during Revised and Fourth Editions, maybe even longer, and at that time, there were no more mono, poly, or continuous artifacts. But as mentioned, Time Vault and Mana Vault and similar had exceptions to still having to pay for untapping.",
