As there is no mana cost listed on Vision, you can't play it from your hand, as you can't pay a non-existent cost.  This means that the only way to play Ancestral Vision is to either cheat it out (which will probably cost you more than it would to just pay U for Recall) or use the Suspend cost, which is, surprise surprise, the same amount of mana it costs to play Ancestral Recall.  Long story short, Recall is better because in the end they're going to cost you the same amount of mana, but Recall comes into effect when you pay the cost while Visions goes off four turns later.  Ancestral Vision was printed pretty much for the sole purpose of making a balanced version of Ancestral Recall.",

I need to eventually Draft Alpha. heck I don't care if you take the Power out-- Alpha Magic is just Cool and Fun even without $1000 dollar cards! :O\nThis is an interesting concept of card. It certainly FEELS like a really Egyptian Curse, which is neat. I like that even though we've never had an explicitly Egyptian Block, there's a lot of cards in Magic that have an Egyptian/Dr. Fate kind of feel to them :)\nThe problem with this card is that being of low converted mana cost, it encourages you to play it early, and that does hurt you much, and you really should never play this in Multiplayer.\nI think {3} is a great number to cast this for, since that could come down early if you have a plan to get around the two-edgedness, but if you don't have enough support and want to throw this down to stop ALL the lands and rely on the lands you have in play, then it's still castable early enough to hurt people but you don't feel like a putz for waiting til turn 5 to cast it.\nI think that it would also just be neat and cool if this was able to sacrifice itself to gain you 2 life, as a one-shot way to make it better for you than your opponent. We've come along way and realized that [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] is very good, and making things too one-sided like with [autocard]Balance[/autocard] is very bad, but most cards should clearly sit somewhere in the middle and basically be something to give you advantage if you play it. As is, this doesn't clearly give you advantage so much as Declare a New Rule for everyone that accelerates the game to end faster. Cards like that are...alright, but usually making tiny tweaks so that the effects aren't REALLY even is a Good Thing, if you don't go overboard and make lots of [autocard]Balance[/autocard]s.\nI want this to feel like an ARTIFACT, not a Red, White, or Black card, if possible. 3 CMC plus the sac clause would make it less like a White New Rule card, less like a Red All In card, and the lifegain would help keep it feeling more Artifact-y than Black :)",

We think the [autocard]virus[/autocard] started when they began [autocard]experiment[/autocard]ing on troops in response to the [autocard]Avenger[/autocard]s [autocard]Initiative[/autocard]. I forgot to mention I'm an [autocard]Agent[/autocard] of SHIELD. Her codename is Lily, because I'll Always love her.\nWe're making camp now, in an Abandoned Warehouse district. Wait. That noise. What is it? Oh. No. \nOh NO. The zombies. They are coming! We cannot get out! Drums, in the deep! We cannot get OUT! They ARE COMING!......\nThis wasn't the End we Deserved. But it was the End we Needed.\n[autocard]APOCALYPSE[/autocard] NOW",

That reason being that no matter what your combo, no matter what card you want to get to win these will help you. \nYawgmoth's Will is a great card, don't get me wrong. But it is not as universally awesome as the power 9. Black Lotus is the king of them all because it goes in any deck as said above. Of course if you have a Time Walk you might load up whatever mono-deck you have with dual lands just so you can slap it in there anyway, but that's a different discussion...\nThe only reasonable arguement anyone could make would be Demonic Tutor or similar cards for the same reason.",

I think the same thing whenever I see someone include [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard] or [autocard]Lotus Petal[/autocard] in their EDH/Commander decks - risky but worth it if you can draw it during the early game.\nIt would be a great help if you went against someone playing land destruction, or land tap ([autocard]telekinetic sliver[/autocard], [autocard]opposition[/autocard], etc) EDH/Commander decks, or if you were playing charged spells that can only get better with more mana ([autocard]comet storm[/autocard], [autocard]banefire[/autocard]), though. Then it wouldn't be so much of a dead draw in the late game (post turn 10). However, by that point there are also better late-game ramp cards ([autocard]Mirari's Wake[/autocard], [autocard]Mana Reflection[/autocard], etc) so its up to you. Early game advantage or late game staying power?",

This did so, in potentially any color deck.- The game was much slower, and land destruction was plentiful and cheap.  Strip Mine, Sinkhole and Ice Storm are not easy cards to recover from early in the game.  This meant your hand might be close to full often, and you might be taking damage from the vise every turn.- While White had Disenchant, Red had Shatter, and Green had Crumble, Black had next to no ways to permanently deal with artifacts, and Blue could also have problems with this.",

I like the idea of cards that are SIMILAR to this, but as they currently stand, they need some depowering to be 'fair'.Also, countering a spell with the only restriction being color, for ONE mana, is a Rare effect and that's been true at any period of the game, either the Counterspell or Cancel eras.Adding any kind of destroying would make it Mythic Rare, but if you upped the cost to Two Mana, and also placed an additional restriction on targeting, they'd be printable at Rare. Maybe. Maybe make the caster discard a card just for good measure, lol. -_-",

The color ward cycle can best be examined as artistic interventions against the oppressive humor archetype, whereas the unappealingly desperate musings of Dan Frazier's eponymous series are truly indebted to Jenny Holzer’s oeuvre. Or, as Baudrillard and Guillaume so succinctly state, \"What is produced with the romantic turn…is…the…play of…masculine hysteria…of …sexual paradigms that once again must be reinserted in the more general and universal context of a change in the paradigms of otherness.\"",

Make Gold Mana.\"\nOf course it is 'primitive', but [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] now looks primitive to people who are gluttonous for ETB creatures. :/ Is Serra Angel ACTUALLY a bad card, or is it GREAT that it paved the way for people to want so many \"My Creature can Attack AND Defend\" cards? (the entire Vigilance keyword probably owes its support to Serra Angel)\n[autocard]Mana Prism[/autocard]\n[autocard]Stalking Stones[/autocard]\n[autocard]Coalition Relic[/autocard]\n[autocard]Darksteel Ingot[/autocard]\n[autocard]Ramos[/autocard] Artifacts\n[autocard]Chromatic Lantern[/autocard]\n[autocard]Fist of Suns[/autocard]\n[autocard]Manalith[/autocard]\n[autocard]Prismatic Lens[/autocard]\n[autocard]Alloy Myr[/autocard]\n[autocard]Extraplanar Lens[/autocard]\n[autocard]Borderpost[/autocard] cycle\n[autocard]Keyrune[/autocard] cycle\n[autocard]Cameo[/autocard] cycle\nAnd the two mana artifacts are even more numberous-\n[autocard]Pentad Prism[/autocard]\nSpheres\n[autocard]Signet[/autocard] cycle\n[autocard]Diamond [/autocard]cycle\n[autocard]Fellwar Stone[/autocard]\n[autocard]Fractured Powerstone[/autocard]\n[autocard]Coldsteel Heart[/autocard]\n[autocard]Copper Myr[/autocard]\n[autocard]Lead Myr[/autocard]\n[autocard]Gold Myr[/autocard]\n[autocard]Silver Myr[/autocard]\n[autocard]Iron Myr[/autocard]\nAnd the 1 mana artifacts:\n[autocard]Chromatic Star[/autocard]\n[autocard]Chromatic Sphere[/autocard]\n[autocard]Barbed Sextant[/autocard]\n[autocard]Egg[/autocard] cycle\nand here are some wierd ones:\n[autocard]Altar of the Lost[/autocard]\n[autocard]Astrolabe[/autocard]\n[autocard]Implements of Sacrifice[/autocard]\nYes. Think about it. In Alpha, there were the Moxen, Sol Ring, Black Lotus, and Mana Vault. I don't think there were any other 'Mana Stones'. All of the actually fair and balanced ones? They come from Celestial Prism, and thinking that 3 mana is the right casting cost for Fixing your Colors. The cards that give only 2 colors are meant to be played in specifically 2-colored Decks, and are really the same concept as the 5-color artifacts. That is why I'm willing to attribute most of the artifacts that produce mana or search for lands as coming indirectly from [autocard]Celestial Prism[/autocard]. The list of cards that come from those more powerful artifacts is much shorter but many of those cards are just more power than you quite need, or at least more power than is interesting enough to tell a real story about.",

Vintage: Play on your [autocard]Mishra's Workshop[/autocard] or [autocard]Tolarian Academy[/autocard] (High Stakes Vintage this works less because it's slow and almost certainly you'd be splashing {W}, not {W} main. Adjusting your deck to be able to cast this more is a GREAT WAY to make such combo decks more fair and fun for Friendly Vintage, and also make your opponents' [autocard]Strip Mine[/autocard] less devastating, particularly if they are running [autocard]Crucible of Worlds[/autocard] with it.\n2. Legacy/EDH: Whatever your most KEY color fixing land is: A Filter Land, a Shock Land, [autocard]Reflecting Pool[/autocard], a Vivid Land, City of Brass: Not as many \"Combos\" in Legacy based off of a Single Land being absolutely balls-to-the-walls BAHROHKAHN, but [autocard]Wasteland[/autocard] is still around for everyone not running [autocard]Blood Moon[/autocard], and this card would be good because it's good against Wasteland even though it 'dies' to Blood Moon. Doesn't stop everything like [autocard]Anathemancer[/autocard], but stops SOME of the LD bleeding, like [autocard]Armageddon[/autocard], [autocard]Jokulhaups[/autocard], that-kinda-stuff, and attacking your opponents' lands is so good that every card that protects lands, even if it's not \"Auto-4-of\", IS \"Auto-Narrowly-Useful\". \n3. Modern: [autocard]Dark Depths[/autocard]? [autocard]Thespian's Stage[/autocard]? Would combos like this be less ban-worthy if LD playability was increased and consequently the idea of a Land Enchantment protection was less laughable? Picture a different format than we see today, one where something close to [autocard]Pillage[/autocard] might be heavily played? Oh Yeah. And [autocard]Inkmoth Nexus[/autocard], [autocard]Mishra's Factory[/autocard] (if they changed their minds about Duel Decks' general card legality state? but then further started with just a [autocard]Demonic Tutor[/autocard] Ban from the cards affected??)\n4. Standard, or any FNM Format, or any Pizza Night Magic at any given time with untuned decks: Man Lands, from Zendikar Duals to [autocard]Mutavault[/autocard], AND even the Xth Edition ones that are less highly praised but still often used for the heck of it. \nAny card that effects lands is a land that impacts the game significantly. The \"play 4 of these on your own and then cast [autocard]Armageddon[/autocard]\" route is exctremely rough and crude, AND YET it still sounds pretty attractive to see if I can even just build that deck and save TWO of my lands while destroying ALL of theirs. \nLands are Legit. Heck I didn't even get around to [autocard]Valakut[/autocard] and even wierder Land interactions. The lists are quite long of the decks that would be happy to see this card.\n(I named cards whose interaction with Consecrate Land seemed to me to resemble about the Power Level of the Play that could make an impact there- in some cases I imagined an Alternate Universe of the Format where the cardpools were different than they actually are, but the average \"Turn Clock\" Power Level of the format was somewhere close to the ballpark of the real world. EVERY single one of these uses is very relevant in Loose EDH, some of these are less feasible to imagine in Higher Powered Formats, like the Man-Duals, but would certainly matter somewhere, like imagine if Man-Duals and this co-existed in Standard: Not good enough for Modern I think, but good enough for Standard Fo Show.)\nThe basic one-sentence evaluation is that it's a much MUCH Spikier, Narrower, Techier [autocard]Terra Eternal[/autocard]. Being more castable probably counts more in the long run than not protecting every single one of your lands does, *particularly* for those Vintage Combos. This card probably make Strip Mine and Wasteland fairer to have 4 of either in Vintage-with-Friends (Vintage where everyone has to sideboard against Dredge is different). You probably wouldn't run 8 LD Lands in Vintage anyway because you want to play as few lands as possible because you want your mana curve to be supertight and need more attack points and spell effects than mana to kill As Fast As Cardboard Possible.",

It's extremely disingenuous and not sportsmanlike at all.\nAnte is a bad concept. It completely eliminates casual play and turns every game into a fear fest because you might lose your cards. It is [i]supposed to[/i] add excitement and suspense to the game because you might win a card, but I don't find stealing peoples cards much fun at all, especially if it was a close match or a really good game. Makes me feel wrong inside. It also discourages new or unskilled players from playing because they know they will probably lose. Even if they don't care if they lose because they just like to play the game, ante will make them care because something is at stake. Also, ante benefits all those arrogant rich kids who have the money to buy 300 booster packs and get all those [autocard]Black Lotus[/autocard]es. Ante makes playing for fun impossible. Magic should be a casual, fun game that anyone can play. Magic is not poker.\nIMO, ante is a terrible rule, but if you play with ante, this card can be good. It is situational in regards that you will only play it if you are winning, and it will either outright win you the game (from your opponent conceding) or you can win an extra card, in the rare exception this backfires on you and you wind up losing. This also, more times than not, just makes your opponent hate you even more than they already do. This is also very black to me.\nThe problem is that a card like this doesn't actually do anything to help you win the game. It changes nothing about the player's states. It would be much better to run a [autocard multiverseid=\"86\"]Terror[/autocard] instead most of the time.\nEven though I hate ante, I will rate purely on objective usefulness of the card. I give it a 1/5, since it is situational (as you must already be winning for it to be practical) and will waste a card slot if you are losing. I like all my cards to be useful whether I'm winning or not.",

Maybe even only use it in Legacy and Vintage, but...SOMEwhere I'd like to be able to see some real Showdowns with Epic Stakes. \nIt IS NOT for everyone...but if Ante was returned to Legacy and Vintage events, then we could Unban all the Ante cards (except [autocard]Contract from Below[/autocard], obvz), and then Restrict the two Black cards that directly reference the Ante....\nwell, I think there is some merit to this.

It just teaches you so much about the game, both offensively and defensively, by giving you that extra power to knock out an opposing creature, allowing your own creatures to survive lethal damage, or forcing through that extra bit of damage to win the game.  It teaches you timing, patience, and resource management, because sometimes you have to hold it instead of playing it even though you have mana open.  Sometimes you need to save up mana expressly to be able to play it in response to things.\nAs you get better at the game, so too does your use of this card evolve with your understanding.  If your opponent knows you have some in your deck, they will sometimes play cautiously because they know you have it, allowing you to play mind games and bluff having it when you don't.  Combined with discard and control elements, you can save multiples in your hand for a fatal attack.  You'll discover synergies for it.  And it's never going to be completely useless, as long as you play green, and you have creatures.\nAll in all, this is the one card in the [i]Alpha[/i] boon cycle that Wizards got completely right.",

Is every creature in the game without protection from white a bad card because [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard] gets rid of it? Of course not.\nEvery card in Magic can be dealt with by one card or another.\nThis is a card that HAS to be dealt with as soon as it's played.  No one wants to loose cards from their hand at random.  Even decks that rely on graveyard interaction have to cast their [autocard]Yagmouths Will[/autocard] or [autocard]Regrow[/autocard] or whatever before the Specter steals it away.  Even one successful attack with this guy can disrupt an entire game.  You loose a land early on, or that card you just tutored for it's a real setback.\nObviously he looses some of his greatness in formats that don't allow [autocard]Dark Rituals[/autocard], but in any format hes a threat as soon as he hits the board.\nEven if I have to wait until my third turn to play him, it's a win win situation no matter what my opponent does.  If you don't have an answer for him in your hand, Im happy to have him hit you for a card turn after turn.  If you do have some kind of removal for him and you get rid of him, well that's one less removal spell you have for my [autocard]Juzam Djinn[/autocard]. \nSure it would be great if he cost [Black] to cast and was a 10/10 with trample and protection from red and protection from white and vigilance ....  but he's not. and its still a great card.",

As a colorless artifact, it can be played in any deck that needs some defense, and at  its cost is not too prohibitive in slower formats.

However, when I play on ***atrice, the oracle text says, that you can only untap Mana Vault at the beginning of your upkeep, which actually stops you from being able to go infinite, i think, since the beginning of the upkeep already ended, after you untapped it for the first time.But every other version really still says something else, like only being able untap it during your upkeep, but nothing about only the beginning of upkeep, for example... really weird...(edit: lol @ getting the word \"***atrice\" censored here)",

Attacking group is blocked as one and can be blocked by any that can block one in the group.3. Player who had banding creature attacking or blocking gets to distribute the incoming damage.It was the 'band with others' that got the situation confusing.All these creatures that give their P/T as +P/+T to attacking or blocking creature when tapped don't work like band. First of all banding is commitment that is done before blockers are announced when the bonus giving is normally done after. Secondly only with a bander gets the defender say how to distribute the damage.But on the other hand, concerning this card: Evasion & banding don't mix very well.",

They've just knocked out your entire hand and set you back for many turns:\n- If you draw a land, you have no spells to cast with it, so it's a dead turn.\n- If you draw a spell or creature, you can't play it because you have no land.\nMeanwhile, you could be taking tons of damage from [autocard]The Rack[/autocard] or having all semblance of a plan being knocked out every turn by [autocard]Hypnotic Specter[/autocard] or [autocard]Juzám Djinn[/autocard] you can't deal with.\nWizards seems to have recognized how degenerate cards like this can be, in conjunction with fast mana.  This is probably why is random discard, and [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard] and its ilk, are gone (or at least costed much less aggressively).  Having no choice of what you discard is an extremely powerful effect, especially when combined with forced discard of multiple cards.  The ability to knock out lands can also completely destroy early-game development, and keep you from executing your game plan completely, which can be extremely hard to overcome.",

It's only one mana, hits black / artifact creatures, and four mana is enough to render the target permanently locked down in almost all circumstances. It would be great to see this reprinted, though perhaps the effect is more appropriate in white's slice of the color pie.

However, I think Wizards soon realized that these tactics were too slow to keep up with the other colors.  For this reason, blue's win conditions have switched to milling, and big flying creatures.  After all, they do seem to work better than little conditional and narrow cards like this, which are cute, but are awful in terms of mana curve (especially in the color of counterspells).",

Mana burn was part of the game for nearly 20 years for a reason. It forces players to actually make calculated decisions with their resources. Without mana burn, players can just haphazardly tap their lands for mana in a sloppy manner. Mana burn also makes cards like Black Lotus, Sol Ring, and Mana Drain slightly balanced. Seriously, these cards would actually be considerably more powerful - if you can imagine that - without the threat of mana burn. Is this what we want?\nThen we have cards like Mana Vault, Mana Crypt, Mishra's Workshop, and the Urza lands. You have to actually think before tapping this cards - if mana burn exists, as it should.\nAnd finally, there's cards like Power Surge, which were obviously designed with the reality of mana burn in mind. Of course, so was Mana Drain - the threat of mana burn was the only thing keeping it even slightly sane!!\nWhy the hell did WotC throw mana burn on the scrapheap? My guess is it was to simplify the game yet further, for the Pokemon kids. Just like eliminating interrupts was. They have changed Magic: the Gathering far too many times in its short lifespan. Imagine if chess went through zillions of changes every decade? It wouldn't have lasted several centuries, that's for sure.",

Psionic Blast is one of the exceptions where planeswalkers could do direct damage to kill a creature or opponent. Combine with other blue control cards, PB is very dangerous, compare to Char is already in a damage-abundant color.

RR kind of reminds me of Crawlspace.  except that it kind of works opposite.  RR effects your attack phase while crawlspace effects your opponents.  with RR your creatures are not going to have to worry about as many blockers and with crawlspace you dont have to worry about as many attackers.  to be honest i gave RR a 5.  alright maybe it aint the best card but theres something that i really like about it.  maybe its just my guilty pleasure.",

Blue Elemental Blast is also still going strong, but I don't think it will appreciate as much longevity. 25 Years? 40 Years? 50 Years? One day, it MAY be the case that Red Permanents are not enough of a concern in Legacy or Vintage and the counterspells they already have are sufficient.I admit, for BEB to not even see sideboard play though, it would probably mean that Red as a Color had somehow become defunct. Of all the colors that could though, Red is the one that actually might. It already is hands down the weakest in Commander. Commander ain't the same as Legacy/Vintage by a mile, but they're more similar to each other than they are to Standard of course.",

Definitely agree that this is somewhat overrated at the moment though.

Under modern rules, the original card wouldn't save your life if you took lethal damage, because you'd drop below 0 (and die as a state-based action) before you could cast it.  On the other hand, with the original wording, if you took damage from a source multiple times in one turn, Reverse Damage would reverse all of it; the Oracle text doesn't allow that.\nPresumably they changed it to prevent the damage because of the rules change that made dying a state-based action; previously you'd only die at the end of the phase, so it could save you if you dropped into negatives.  But that doesn't explain why it's no longer capable of reversing damage retroactively when you've been damaged multiple times by the same source -- or why [autocard]Reverse Polarity[/autocard], which had nearly identical wording to this originally, has an Oracle text that goes the other way (failing to save you from lethal damage, but allowing you to reverse damage retroactively and to cover something that has damaged you multiple times in one turn.)",

I won several tournament games with several of these guys doing all the damage.  Why?  Because the bigger creatures kept getting nuked and these were all that was left.  So, each turn I just kept poking away.  When playing against direct damage, if you have a couple creatures out there plus a couple of these, then these have to be nuked first, or your opponent has to pay more to kill the bigger creatures.  Imagine the frustration as your opponent tries to calculate how many mana to use on each creature... will you save this one or that one?  Will you split the differentce and prevent one to each?  Is that a Healing Salve in your hand?  It's highly entertaining!",

Plus, I really love the real-world flavor text from Coleridge. (People seem to think we've discontinued real-world flavor text, but there has been some amount of it in every Core Set. Chances are that you've just stopped paying attention.)\nScathe Zombies didn’t make it into M10—I really loved the idea of a redone [autocard]Nantuko Husk[/autocard] ([autocard]Vampire Aristocrat[/autocard]) at common and we don't really want to do strictly-better cards at the same rarity—and now its down to either [autocard]Giant Spider[/autocard] or [autocard]Giant Growth[/autocard] as the only card to appear in every Core Set (tune into M12 for the winner!). [autocard]Warpath Ghoul[/autocard] and its twin [autocard]Barony Vampire[/autocard] have become the new [2B] black vanilla creatures of choice.\nTruthfully, [2B] 2/2 is too weak to be on-curve—it hampers all the two- and three-mana creatures you can make in that color. Scathe Zombies just wasn't holding up well, as we printed [autocard]Bog Raiders[/autocard], [autocard]Blood Vassal[/autocard], [autocard]Quagmire Druid[/autocard], and tons of other commons that are better than him while he was in print. And it's hard to call [autocard]Warpath Ghoul[/autocard] \"power creep\" with a straight face, as all we did was take a card you'd never really consider playing in constructed and turn it into a slightly better card that you'll still never really consider playing in constructed, even ten years ago—they both essentially rate as \"0.\"\nThen again, Scathe Zombies is quite a bit better than [autocard]Mindless Null[/autocard]. Power creep indeed!",

      "content": "[b]@ Nyktos:[/b]\nWell, the toughness 3 of [autocard]Trained Armodon[/autocard] really matters. Since if you look at the M12 statistics, 44 cards have a power of 2, whereas only 13 have a power of 3. That really makes the Armodon quite a powerful card. The second green mana however was removed for multicolor-limited reasons, leaving enough room to also make the black version a bit more powerful.\n[b]@ Aaron:[/b]\nAlthough I never really liked the power curve of magic (since power 1 means 20 hits and power 2 means half that much), I never felt happy with 2/2 for 3. In a usual game, the cmc3 slot is what I call the \"pants down\" slot, where you usually recognize how the game is gonna be. There are cards like [autocard]Tempered Steel[/autocard] makes it obvious that no-fattie will see play. [autocard]Seismic Assault[/autocard] proves that it's some sort of fast combo kill, whereas an [autocard]Pyrexian Arena[/autocard] symbolizes an attrition deck.\nBut also non-enchantment cards fulfill this criteria. F.e. all the lords cost 3 mana to cast.\nSeeing an underwhelming Zombie (even the 3/2 version) in this slot, makes me shiver and I would have rather see a 2/2 Zombie for [1B]. Not only would this card still have the same P/T rating as any zombie token, it would also show that there is no need to give black weaker creatures than white or green. Neither black destruction spells nor reanimation are powerful enough to force a drawback on creatures. In addition, this zombie would really symbolize a mindless minion and would have MUCH more flavor than any [autocard]Glory Seeker[/autocard] or [autocard]Runeclaw Bear[/autocard].\nSpealing of these two cards, green should have the cmc3 vanilla creature to use the \"pants down\" slot for a vanilla creature to show the creature focus of this color.",

They let the artists inject such originality into their new world and created a unique flavor for their unique game. it would have been much less risky to stick with boring, classic, archetypal fantasy art, but they rolled the dice with a lot of early art and hit a home run.

Now, it's a little bit under-powered by today's standards, though. Consider the abilities of the Kamigawa dragons (which have the same P/T and CMC) in contrast. And then there's the Thundermaw that totally changes the expectations for a 5 or 6 CMC creature. Great as it once was, the Shivan will probably never see pro use again (well, unless WotC underpowers subsequent sets to make it viable again).",

So using Fireball again, if it was set to do 5 damage, you have to pay  to counter it. Fireball's 'additional targets' ability doesn't count to the CMC though.

You're unlikely to have a problem casting Spell Blast, especially on cards from this era.  However, keeping enough mana open to Power Sink someone in way that kills not just their spell but also their turn by tap out, kind of restricts your own play as well.

Some of Magic's old art looks dated or bad in comparison to today's offerings, but this card's art is almost iconic.  Black was my favourite colour getting into this game (around 4th to 5th edition), and this card was great removal with great flavour.  \nIn fact, the printed text for 5th Ed was \"Bury target nonartifact, nonblack creature\", so when I first saw the art, I assumed that the guy in the picture has been buried alive, frozen with that look of fear on his face!  The fact that black and artifact creatures are immune to \"fear effects\" is so flavourful, too.  \nDoom Blade is certainly more versatile and functional these days, but Terror is just so much more primal, and I think I will always like it better than its new cousin for that.",

Sort of like how the land subtype 'Forest' inherently adds \": Add  to your mana pool.\" to what ever land it's on. The alternative was 'Poly Artifact' that did not need the  and so could be activated multiple times a turn. Pyramids being one of these. And other was 'Continuous Artifact' that needed no activation, but had static or triggered abilities, like Enchantments. One you should be familiar with is Howling Mine, which only recently left Standard.

This is an interesting card because it doesn't fit very well into the theme of what red is generally trying to do. Red generally wants you dead, right about now. This card really doesn't support that aim from red at all.\nAs a defensive card as well, this compares poorly to other cards in other colours that do similar things. For example from modern sets, [autocard]Wall of Frost[/autocard] is a modern take on this card that is much better. Costing 1UU, it is in a colour that is more interested in a defensive creature, and it can \"handle\" two creatures at once. While Wall of Fire can block and kill things, red doesn't generally want to be doing that. Other recent cards it compares poorly to include [autocard]Wall Of Omens[/autocard] or [autocard]Wall of Denial[/autocard]\nIf Wall Of Fire was printed in a modern set (and it was as recently as M10), I think it would (and it did) be a fringe playable limited card.

Very few walls have more than 2 power, and almost all of them have 0.
